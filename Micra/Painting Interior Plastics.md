Sand it down before spraying. If you use a finer grade such as 400 then it won't remove the pattern and it helps the paint stick better and removes anything that shouldn't be there.  As others have said make sure its cleaned first so there are no substances which cause the paint to run or react.  Also use 800 grade to sand between coats to give a nice even finish, but make sure its dry before you start sanding. More thin coats are better because if it goes on too thick it will create runs in the paint which you don't want.  A few coats of lacquer should finish it off but make sure the paint is dry first
