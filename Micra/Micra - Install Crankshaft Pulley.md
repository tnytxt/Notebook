Could I tap the pulley onto the crankshaft until the crankshaft bolt can screw on and then use an impact drive ( Electric - Using car battery ) to screw the bolt on which in effect will force the pulley onto the crankshaft or would that be too forceful an possible damage the screw threads ?

1. Make sure that the surface of the shaft and the bore of the pulley are clean and free of burrs-clean them up with fine wet and dry to get rid of any corrosion.
2. Lubricate the shaft with a little smear of copa-slip rubbed all over it. Grease the land where the crank seal runs.
3. Warm the hub of the pulley up with a hot air gun so that when you spit on it it steams and sizzles a little.
4. Fit the pulley onto the shaft quickly and follow up with the crankshaft bolt and washer and torque up.

 >You're seriously suggesting the OP should apply a lubricant to a taper? 

>Tom -it doesn't sound like a taper if the OP is talking about using the crank pulley bolt to pull the pulley onto the shaft does it?
#### Assuming crankshaft is parallel, not tapered.

- To be on the safe side for heating the pulley, heat it in a domestic oven set to 100 centigrade.
- If there is a seal that runs on the surface of the pulley at the back, lubricate it sparingly with ordinary general purpose grease, so that the seal doesn't run dry when starting the engine.
- Better to use an ordinary socket ratchet wrench to wind in the crankshaft bolt and then use a torque wrench set the the correct torque to final tighten it.
- If the spigot on the crankshaft is tapered, You'll not need to do anything, The pulley will practically fall on and it will be crucial that you tighten the securing bolt to the correct torque.If it is a stretch type bolt, You'll need a new bolt too.
#### Conclusion
If shaft tapered, no lube required
New bolt needed if old bolt is a "stretch" bolt
