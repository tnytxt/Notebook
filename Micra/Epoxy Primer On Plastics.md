Will be fine. I purposely left some in the bottom of a mixing cup and  
when fully cured popped it out. I always do this with any new-to-me two  
part paint to see how flexible/hard it is. It's surprisingly rubbery and flexible.  
The only issue would be the type of plastic and the primers adhesion to it.  

If it's a waxy plastic such as polypropylene (coded/marked PP) or  
polyethylene (coded PE) then it will need adhesion promoter first.
