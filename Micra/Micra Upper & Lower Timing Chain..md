**Micra Timing Chain Overview**

The Micra features both upper and lower timing chains, which are kept quiet by tension from plastic-lined tensioner shoes that press against the chain. 

- **Lower Timing Chain:** Driven by the crankshaft, with the tensioner located in the middle.
  
- **Upper Timing Chain:** Drives the camshaft. The yellow component is the tensioner, which often causes the common timing chain rattle.

**Causes of Noisy Chains:**
A noisy chain can result from:
- Excess slack (tensioner unable to apply sufficient tension).
- Worn plastic lining on the tensioner, exposing bare metal.

During cold starts, insufficient oil pressure means the springs inside the tensioners provide minimal tension, allowing the chain to rattle for about 1-3 seconds until oil pressure builds. Once the oil pump generates enough pressure, the oil light goes out, and the tensioners are hydraulically activated, quieting the system.

If the chain continues to rattle loudly after 3 seconds, it may indicate:
- Insufficient or zero oil pressure reaching the tensioner (due to clogged oil passages, low pressure from worn bearings, or a failing pump).
- Worn tensioner shoes or a stretched chain.

**Next Steps:**
As Davy suggests, changing the oil and filter to the correct grade is advisable. Use 10W-40 for normal conditions or 15W-40 for worn engines to help increase oil pressure.

If rattling persists when warm, inspect and service the tensioner or consider replacing the engine.

**Tensioner Servicing Steps:**
1. Remove the upper timing chain access panel.
2. Unbolt and remove the tensioner.
3. Assess the condition of the plastic shoe.
4. Clean the oil passages in the tensioner and engine head to remove debris.
5. Reset the tensioner’s ratchet stopper.
6. Reinstall the tensioner and push the shoe inward to release the ratchet mechanism.
7. Install the cover and check for rattling.
