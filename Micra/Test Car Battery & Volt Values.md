  You can push a bad battery to the 12.7v area, but if it drop to about 10v when a small load is applied... you possibly have one dead cell. As for the alternator charging increase the load and observe the drops  

To test your car battery’s health, start by fully charging it and measuring the voltage. A healthy battery should read around 12.7 volts at rest. However, if you apply a small load (such as turning on the headlights) and the voltage quickly drops to about 10 volts, this likely indicates a dead cell in the battery.

For checking the alternator, start the engine and gradually increase the electrical load (for example, by turning on the headlights, radio, and air conditioning). Observe the voltage with a multi-meter at the battery terminals. A healthy alternator should maintain a voltage between 13.8 and 14.5 volts. If the voltage drops significantly as you add load, the alternator may not be functioning properly.

**Battery State of Charge Table**

| State of Charge | 12V Battery (V) | 6V Battery (V) |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 100% (Fully Charged) | 12.7 | 6.3 |
| 75% | 12.4 | 6.2 |
| 50% | 12.2 | 6.1 |
| 25% | 12.0 | 6.0 |
| Dead | 11.9 or less | 5.9 or less |

**Tip:** Always measure voltage after the battery has rested (with no load) for the most accurate reading.
