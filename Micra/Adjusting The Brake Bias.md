If you look behind the rear nearside wheel the rear brake pipes run to a compensator that adjusts break bias when the cars loaded up with people etc. If you lower the car without adjusting it its like your always driving with the car loaded (in terms of brake bias)

The adjuster has a nut on the top to adjust it you'll need to screw it down to bring its arm that connects it to the compensator

when resting at stock height the little nut at the end of the spring rod pulls the bias arm away from the internal valve plunger, so to zero pressure on the valve the brake fluid can flow in & out freely

When the rear is lowered below stock the nut no longer pulls the arm back at rest and instead allows the spring to push up against the bias arm which then applies force against the valve plunger causing a constant restriction.

When braking, the brake pressure from the master cylinder can overcome this restriction, rear brakes would respond a little slower. But when releasing the brake pedal the rear brakes return spring may not be strong enough to overcome this restriction so the fluid retains the pressure and the brakes bind

So what you need to do is lower the nut till it pulls the bias arm back out, just enough to relieve
