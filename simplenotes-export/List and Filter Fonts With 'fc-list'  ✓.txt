List and Filter Fonts With 'fc-list'  ✓

**fc-list | grep**

The command `fc-list | grep` is used in a Unix-like operating system to list available fonts and filter the output based on a specific search term.

Here's a breakdown of the command:

1. **`fc-list`**: This command lists all the fonts available on the system. It provides details about each font, including its file path and other metadata.

2. **`|`**:  is a pipe operator that takes the output of the command on its left (`fc-list`) and uses it as the input for the command on its right (`grep`).

3. **`grep`**: This command is used to search for specific patterns in the input it receives. However, in this case, the command is incomplete because `grep` requires a search term or pattern to filter the output.

For example, if you wanted to find all fonts that contain the word "Arial," you would use the cmd like this:  

`fc-list | grep Arial`

This would list all the fonts that include "Arial" in their names or paths. Without a search term, the command as it stands will not produce any meaningful output.

**fc-list Options**  

1. **Filtering by Pattern**: You can specify a pattern to filter the fonts listed. For example:
   
   `fc-list : family | grep Arial`  
   This would list only the font families that match "Arial."

2. **Output Formatting**: You can customize the output format using the `:` syntax. For example:
   `fc-list : family, style`  
   This command will list the font families along with their styles.

3. **Specifying a Directory**: You can limit the search to a specific directory containing font files:
  `fc-list /path/to/fonts`

4. **Listing Font Properties**: List specific properties of fonts, like family, style, file path. For example:
   `fc-list : family, style, file`

5. **Using Environment Variables**: You can set environment variables to influence the behavior of `fc-list`, such as `FONTPATH`, which specifies additional directories to search for fonts.

6. **Check Font Presence**: Without displaying the entire font list (or any pattern) using fc-list in Bash 
    `fc-list | grep -q "Arabic" && echo "Font is present." || echo "Font is not present."`

    💡Tip:  You can condense the below multi line bash cmd, into a single line bash cmd like above using the **`&&`** and **`||`** operators, known as Logical Operators used to combine conditions  

    ```bash
    if fc-list | grep -q "Arabic"; then
  echo "Font is present."
else
  echo "Font is not present."
fi
```

While `fc-list` is focused on font management, its options allow for a variety of ways to query and display font information, making it a versatile tool for working with fonts on a system. However, it does not perform functions unrelated to font management.
