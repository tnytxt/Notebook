- Used for basic mathematical operations.
    - Addition: +
    - Subtraction: -
    - Multiplication: *
    - Division: /
    - Modulus: %

- Compare values and return true or false.
    - Equal to: -eq
    - Not equal to: -ne
    - Greater than: -gt
    - Less than: -lt
    - Greater than or equal to: -ge
    - Less than or equal to: -le

**Boolean (Logical) Operators**

- Used for logical operations and conditional statements.
    - AND: \&\&
    - OR: ||
    - NOT: !

**Bitwise Operators**

- Operate at the bit level within integer values.
    - AND: \&
    - OR: |
    - XOR: ^
    - NOT: ~
    - Left Shift: <<

**String Operators**

- Perform operations on string values.
    - Equal to: =
    - Not equal to: !=
    - String length is zero: -z
    - String length is non-zero: -n

**File Test Operators**

- Test properties of files and directories.
    - Exists: -e
    - Is a directory: -d
    - Is a regular file: -f
    - Is readable: -r
    - Is writable: -w
    - Is executable: -x
    - Has size greater than zero: -s

**Assignment Operators**

- Assign values to variables.
    - Assignment: =
[^5]

**Other Operators**

- Ternary Operator: Used for concise conditional expressions (in some shells).
- Redirection and Pipe Operators: For input/output control (e.g., >, <, |).
