
To keep our notes in github, it should be in a git repository. So first let make a repository.

```
mkdir ~/Notescd ~/Notesgit initecho "My first note" > firstnote.mdgit add .git commit -m "Creating first Note"
```

Done. Now we have created a git repository. Lets push it to github. To do this, create a private git repository in github.

Now, we will link our local repository to github(remote) repository

```
git remote add origin git@github.com:<your-username>/<repo-name>.gitgit push --set-upstream origin master
```

Done. So now we have a repository on hand to save our notes. Now we can add/edit notes. Commit the changes and push them to remote. Now, lets automate it ;)

```
#!/bin/bashcd $(dirname `which $0`)git pullgit add .git commit -m "Notes - $(date)"git pushecho "Done"
```

Copy this code and save in a file named ‘git-sync.sh’ in your project root directory (~/Notes in this example) and make it executable `chmod +x ~/Notes/git-sync.sh`

Now create a new notes file and save it. Then simply run `sh git-sync.sh` . You can see your note in github immediately.

Now, lets become more lazy..

We are working on code editor, we may save notes right from the editor, and we cannot run `sh git-sync.sh` every time. So it should run every time when we save a file. We will automate this as well.

I’ll show you an example with VS Code — My favourite editor (You continue to read this, and then you can google to find how to do it in your favourite editor)

This [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dionmunk.vscode-notes) is what I use to write notes right from VS Code. You can configure your notes directory to your repository. To do this, add following snippet in your VS code `settings.json`

```
"Notes.notesLocation": "/<your-home>/Notes"
```

Now you can see your notes added in Notes repository are visible in editor itself. Now we can edit your notes right from VS Code.

Seeing our first note in VS code

But it is not in sync with github. To sync, we should trigger `git-sync.sh` right. Well.

There is another [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pucelle.run-on-save) in VS Code which allows you to do something when a file is saved. Install this extension and then open \`settings.json\`

```
{   "runOnSave.commands": [      {         "match": "/<your-home>/Notes/.*",         "notMatch": "",         "command": "/<your-home>/Notes/git-sync.sh",         "runIn": "backend",         "runningStatusMessage": "Syncing Notes...",         "finishStatusMessage": "Notes Sync Successful"      }   ],   "runOnSave.statusMessageTimeout": 5000}
```

Add the following settings to your settings.json file.

Now try to edit something and save the notes. You can see `Syncing Notes...` message in status bar.

Syncing notes to github repository

Well done. Go to your github repository and see your notes is updated there as well. Cool

This is the easiest way I find to write notes right from the code editor and getting it saved in remote at no cost.
