**Emperor Moth** *(Saturnia pavonia)*.

Moths may not be as beguiling and romantic as butterflies, but we should view them in a new light, suggests David Tomlinson. 

> “A moth is a butterfly suffering from poor public relations,” an enthusiast once remarked. While humorous, this statement holds truth—while we celebrate butterflies, we often neglect moths.

Physiologically, there’s little difference between the two, aside from the butterfly’s distinctive clubbed antennae. Both share the same lifecycle: egg, caterpillar, chrysalis, and adult.

### Garden Tiger *(Arctia caja)*   
![Garden Tiger](https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/06/garden-tiger-300x191.jpg)

If the distinctive garden tiger is a species you remember from childhood but haven’t seen in a while, you’re not alone. The charity Butterfly Conservation reports a 92% decline in this species over the past 40 years, likely due to the detrimental effects of milder, wetter winters on caterpillar survival.

### Death’s-head Hawk-moth *(Acherontia atropos)*

![Death’s-head Hawk-moth](https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/06/death-hawk-head-moth-300x191.jpg)  

The ultimate prize for moth-trappers, the giant death’s-head hawk-moth (with a wingspan of nearly 5 inches) is a tropical African species that occasionally vagrants to northern Europe. Its distinctive skull on the thorax and ability to emit high-pitched squeaks contribute to its reputation as a bad omen.

### Narrow-bordered Bee Hawk-moth *(Hemaris tityus)*

![Narrow-bordered Bee Hawk-moth](https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/06/narrow-bordered-bee-300x191.jpg)  

This day-flying moth closely mimics a bumblebee, but its faster and more agile flight allows it to skim from bloom to bloom in flower-rich meadows. Once widespread, it has declined due to the loss of unimproved pastures and chalk downland.

### Silver Y *(Autographa gamma)*

![Silver Y](https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/06/silver-Y-300x191.jpg)  

The most common migrant moth, easily identified by the distinctive metallic Y on each forewing. In some years, it arrives in southern England in large numbers, often alongside painted lady butterflies. Although chiefly crepuscular, newly arrived Silver Y moths will feed during the day.

### Black Arches *(Lymantria monacha)*

![Black Arches](https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/06/black-arches-300x191.jpg)  

This attractive black-and-white moth is widely distributed in the oak woods of southern England, where it is not generally considered a problem. However, on the Continent, its caterpillars consume pine needles, leading to major infestations that can kill pine trees.

### Hummingbird Hawk-moth *(Macroglossum stellatarum)*

![Hummingbird Hawk-moth](https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/06/hummingbird-hawk-moth-300x191.jpg)  

No moth is more aptly named. A migrant to the British Isles, it arrives in variable numbers each summer, feeding by day on nectar-rich flowers like jasmine, buddleia, phlox, and nicotiana, hovering in front of blooms to sip nectar.

### Fox *(Macrothylacia rubi)*

![Fox](https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/06/fox-moth-300x191.jpg)  

The nocturnal, grey-brown female is seldom seen, while the foxy-red-brown male undertakes late-afternoon flights over heathland in search of a mate. Their flight is powerful, erratic, and typically just above the ground.

### Lunar Hornet *(Sesia bembeciformis)*

![Lunar Hornet](https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/06/lunar-hornet-300x191.jpg)  

Few moths mimic other species as well as the lunar hornet moth, which resembles a large hornet and emits a menacing hornet-like buzz. Note the absence of the wasp’s distinctive waist between the abdomen and thorax.

### Six-spot Burnet *(Zygaena filipendulae)*

![Six-spot Burnet](https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/06/six-spot-burnet-300x191.jpg)  

This familiar species is commonly found throughout the British Isles, though in the North, it is restricted to the coast. A day-flyer, it is most often seen in sunny weather and is the only one of six closely related UK species with six red (occasionally yellow) spots.

### Latticed Heath *(Chiasmia clathrata)*

![Latticed Heath](https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/06/latticed-heath-300x191.jpg)  

This moth is equally comfortable flying by day or night. A common and wide-ranging species, its coloration varies from white to yellowish. Its habit of folding its wings vertically over its back can lead to misidentification as a butterfly.

### Emperor *(Saturnia pavonia)*

![Emperor](https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/06/emperor-300x191.jpg)  

Arguably the most beautiful moth, the butterfly-like emperor is widespread throughout the British Isles. Fast-flying males are often seen by day, using their remarkable sense of smell and complex antennae to locate mates from a mile away, while females fly only at night.

### Mottled Beauty *(Alcis repandata)*

![Mottled Beauty](https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/06/mottled-beauty-300x191.jpg)  

Few insects take camouflage to such extremes as the mottled beauty, whose coloring varies by region to suit its background. A common and widespread species, it flies in June and July, often in woodlands and suburban gardens, where it is frequently overlooked.

### Peppered *(Biston betularia)*

![Peppered Moth](https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/06/peppered-300x191.jpg)  

Famous for demonstrating evolution in action, the melanic form of this species was first found in Manchester in 1848. Within about 50 years, it made up 98% of the local population due to its effective camouflage against soot-blackened trees. The normal salt-and-pepper coloring provides excellent protection in more typical conditions.

### Speckled Yellow *(Pseudopanthera macularia)*

![Speckled Yellow](https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/06/speckled-yellow-300x191.jpg)  

This sun-loving species is often encountered in woodlands during May and June and is frequently mistaken for a butterfly. The coloration and extent of the brown blotches vary, but there are no similar moths to confuse it with. It is common in southern England and occurs as far north as central and western Scotland.

### Angle Shades *(Phlogophora meticulosa)*

![Angle Shades](https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/06/angle-shade-300x191.jpg)  

The delicately scalloped wings of the angle shades make it one of the easiest moths to identify. Widely distributed throughout the British Isles, it is most common in the South, where it can be seen in every month. Its caterpillars feed on a wide variety of plants, making it a frequent visitor to gardens.

### Spring Usher *(Agriopis leucophaearia)*

![Spring Usher](https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/06/spring-usher-300x191.jpg)  

One of the first moths of the year, it can appear as early as January. Males fly to the wingless females. The leaf-green coloring of the caterpillar matches the young oak leaves on which it feeds, but many are preyed upon by tits and other birds.

### Red Underwing *(Catocala nupta)*

![Red Underwing](https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/06/red-underwing-300x191.jpg)  

At rest, with its hindwings hidden, this large moth is perfectly camouflaged. However, when disturbed, it flashes its vivid hindwings to startle predators. It is quite common in the southern half of Britain and is extending its range north, often found in gardens during August and September.

### Kentish Glory *(Endromis versicolora)*

![Kentish Glory](https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/06/kentish-glory-300x191.jpg)  

The name can be misleading, as this beautifully marked species was lost from Kent in 1868 and is now restricted to the Scottish Highlands. Understanding its specialist requirements (it needs regenerating birch saplings) supports the case for reintroducing it to sites where it once thrived.

### Elephant Hawk-moth *(Deilephila elpenor)*

![Elephant Hawk-moth](https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/06/elephant-hawk-moth-300x191.jpg)

This exquisitely beautiful species, with its crimson blush, is a common resident throughout the British Isles. In gardens, its caterpillars are often found on fuchsias. Adults rarely fly until well after dark but are strongly attracted to light. The name comes from the caterpillar’s distinctive trunk-like snout.

### Cinnabar *(Tyria jacobaeae)*  

![Cinnabar](https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/06/cinnabar-300x191.jpg)  

Easily disturbed during the day, the flashing crimson underwings of the cinnabar serve as a warning to predators that it is toxic
