It was buried under some papers, beside a thick, water-logged book frozen solid in the January chill. I ran my fingers down its spine and read the title: *How to Run A Successful Golf Course*. The owner of the Penn Hills Resort in the Poconos probably hadn’t followed whatever advice the author had to offer. They boarded the place up years ago, and there’s a gaping hole in the roof of his old office. Muted greens and yellows, shag carpeting peek at me through a sheet of ice.\r\n\r\nThe matchbook, which looks to be from the ’60s, is about half-empty—whoever was sitting here when this place finally went under surely needed a smoke.\r\n\r\n![](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/wp.uploads.wamu.org/uploads/sites/3/2017/08/matches.gif)\r\n\r\n> On the inside of the matchbook, some text: “Swim n’ Sun Indoor Swimming Pool at Penn Hills Lodge and Cottages. The Poconos’ Finest Modern Resort.” \r\n\r\nIts cover is a reminder of better days. Swimmers are frolicking at the resort’s indoor pool, now a scene of trash, mangled deck chairs, a life preserver. I lock eyes with a huge bullfrog who didn’t make it out. He was entombed in the ice. The matchbook no longer lines up with reality. I look down through the viewfinder of my camera and up again at the matchbook, aligning the two images the best I can. Up (snap) down (snap). It feels like I’m seeing this place in some sort of dystopian View-Master, each image on the wheel darker than the next.\r\n\r\nWeeks later, I score a cache of old postcards from the Poconos and Catskills on eBay, the sort that end up in family albums, stuck in some box in the attic. “Our Honeymoon\". In idyllic scenes at Penn Hills, the Homowack Lodge, Grossinger’s, and a fourth resort in the Poconos that we aren’t identifying, vacation-goers and honeymooners frolic in the mountains.\r\n\r\nThey have a surreal quality. Ephemeral, disposable, they served only one purpose — to let someone know “I’m here. I’m thinking of you.” It feels a bit like social media does sometimes, where you’ll snap a photo of some vista, sometimes to bring those you care about a bit closer to you. And like social media, the postcards manage to be a little impersonal: “I didn’t quite care enough to write a letter.” It’s analog Foursquare, a nondigital check-in.\r\n\r\nOver the past few years, I’ve gone back to the places in the postcards.\r\n\r\nOn Christmas Day a few years back, I went into an abandoned bowling alley in the Catskills, stood up some pins and bowled a couple of frames. That signature sound — the pins caroming about— sounds a lot different in a place like that. There are echoes of the postcard, where a bear of a man stands at the shoe rental counter. No shoes now, no phone, no counter.\r\n\r\n![](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/wp.uploads.wamu.org/uploads/sites/3/2017/08/homowack2.gif)\r\n\r\n*A lane attendant at the Homowack lodge in the Catskills.*\r\n\r\nOther times, the search is a bit more challenging. I trudged through an old resort in the Poconos last year, just a few months after a fire burned half the place down. In the postcard, a couple poses in front of a gazebo. Now, it’s just a pit in the ground. Time is a sinkhole.\r\n\r\nPhotos of abandonment tend to be a bit stylized, painting decay with a nostalgic brush. The postcards, too, have their own haze — the places were never as nice as they look. I often struggle to get the two images to line up, as well. But time blurs the difference, and brings everything into focus.\r\n\r\n![](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/wp.uploads.wamu.org/uploads/sites/3/2017/08/GrossingersPool.gif)\r\n\r\n*The indoor pool at Grossinger’s, which opened in 1958.*   \r\n\r\nElizabeth Taylor attended the pool’s opening, and Florence Chadwick — the first woman to swim the English Channel in both directions — took the first dip in it. From Ross Padluck’s excellent Lost Architecture of Paradise: “…The new indoor pool at Grossinger’s was the zenith of the Catskills. Nothing quite like it had ever been built, and nothing ever would be again. It represented everything about the Catskills in the 1950s-style: extravagance, luxury, modernism and celebrity.” \r\n\r\n![](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/wp.uploads.wamu.org/uploads/sites/3/2017/08/grossingers2.gif)\r\n\r\nMore of the indoor pool at Grossinger’s. The tiled floor was heated, the entire structure air conditioned. Above, beautiful mid-century “sputnik” chandeliers cast a glow on the swimmers below. Below the pool are exercise rooms, a gym, salon and a host of other amenities. The pool has sat vacant since the late ’90s and has fallen beyond repair.\r\n\r\n![](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/wp.uploads.wamu.org/uploads/sites/3/2017/08/homowack.gif)\r\n\r\nThe Homowack Lodge now sits abandoned on the southern edge of the famed \"Borscht Belt.\" On its lower level, maybe the highlight of the place, a four-lane Brunswick bowling alley. It has seen better days. The resort closed in the mid-2000s but lived on briefly, first as a Hasidic resort and lastly as the site of a summer camp—one that was forced to shut down after the NY Dept of Environmental Conservation deemed it uninhabitable\r\n\r\n![](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/wp.uploads.wamu.org/uploads/sites/3/2017/08/poc4.gif)\r\n\r\nThe caption on the back of this Pocono resort’s postcard touts this theater as the “resort world’s most modern showplace.” With a capacity of 1200, it remains splendorous even in disrepair. This postcard is also postmarked, and filled out. “Having a lovely weekend here. All pleasure – only exercise is rowing a boat and playing shuffleboard! Nice to be lady-like and not “rushing” about! We will see you soon.”\r\n\r\n![](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/wp.uploads.wamu.org/uploads/sites/3/2017/08/poc9.gif)\r\n\r\nAfter a fire destroyed the main building at this resort in the Poconos, a replacement went up in the early ’70s. It is a truly striking sight, a modernist spaceship tucked away deep in the woods. \r\n\r\n![](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/wp.uploads.wamu.org/uploads/sites/3/2017/08/poc10.gif)\r\n\r\nLooking down the side of that same ’70s structure. “Ultra-modern building houses the dining room, cocktail lounge, lobbies and offices.”\r\n\r\n![](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/wp.uploads.wamu.org/uploads/sites/3/2017/08/poc12.gif)\r\n\r\nAnother view.\r\n\r\n![](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/wp.uploads.wamu.org/uploads/sites/3/2017/08/poc5.gif)\r\n\r\nA residential building at a Poconos resort sits in disrepair. On the back of the postcard: “Dear Bernie – Don’t think we forgot you – but we’re having such a grand time that post cards are a chore! This is the life & the place & the people are grand. We couldn’t be happier or have more fun. See you soon! Love, Lou & Shiela.”\r\n\r\n![](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/wp.uploads.wamu.org/uploads/sites/3/2017/08/birchwood.gif)\r\n\r\nPostcard caption: “Birchwood is the only resort offering three swimming pool facilities, indoor pool, outdoor pool and lake with beach. Pictured here is beautiful Eagle Lake, at the foot of the Village Green. Here couples enjoy the white-sand beach, chaise lounges, bicycle and row boats, and fish off its shores … Six low-cost all-expense package plans include indoor swimming, airplane rides, movies, bowling, horseback riding, all winter sports and 40 other free activities!” More recently, the hangar at the resort’s airstrip served a different purpose: cop killer Eric Frein made the place his home during a weeks-long manhunt and was eventually apprehended just a stone’s throw from Eagle Lake.

(Photograph by Pablo Iglesias Maurer, postcard published by Kardmaster Brochures)\r\n\r\n![](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/wp.uploads.wamu.org/uploads/sites/3/2017/08/grossingers1.gif)\r\n\r\nGrossinger’s indoor tennis center. The rear of the postcard is an ad for Grossinger’s rye bread, a local staple during the resort’s operation. Resort royalty Jenny Grossinger lays out the pitch: “The fun and fresh air people get here at Grossinger’s really gives them an appetite. They love all of our food – and a particular favorite is our Grossinger’s rye and pumpernickel bread. Now you can get this same healthy, flavourful bread at your local food store. Try a loaf. I’m sure you’ll love it.”\r\n\r\n![](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/wp.uploads.wamu.org/uploads/sites/3/2017/08/JennyJ.gif)\r\n\r\nThe Mies van der Rohe-inspired “Jenny G Wing” opened in 1964 and was among the last structures erected at Grossinger’s. It was designed by famed architect Morris Lapidus—the man who near-singlehandedly created the “Miami Modern” look in hotels and, more locally, designed the Capitol Skyline Hotel. \r\n\r\n![](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/wp.uploads.wamu.org/uploads/sites/3/2017/08/poc1.gif)\r\n\r\nSunbathing and swimming in the Poconos, postmarked 1967. “Dear Jonnie: If you were only here, I would take you out for a horse-back ride – or else we could go golfing. Be good until I see you. Dr. Waterman.”\r\n\r\n![](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/wp.uploads.wamu.org/uploads/sites/3/2017/08/poc7.gif)\r\n\r\nStairs lead down to an abandoned theater in the Poconos. The curtain last fell here sometime in the early ’90s.\r\n\r\n![](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/wp.uploads.wamu.org/uploads/sites/3/2017/08/poc8.gif)\r\n\r\nThe browns and reds and oranges of this Poconos dining hall’s carpet have turned green, the color of the moss that’s taken its place. \r\n\r\n![](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/wp.uploads.wamu.org/uploads/sites/3/2017/08/outdoorpool.gif)\r\n\r\nGrossinger’s Olympic-size outdoor pool, built in 1949 at a cost of $400,000 (about $5 million in today’s market). Long gone are the private cabanas, changing room and lounges that used to surround it.\r\n\r\n![](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/wp.uploads.wamu.org/uploads/sites/3/2017/08/poc3.gif)\r\n\r\nSummer in the Poconos.",

      "content": "If there are 10,772 people in cock city\r\n---\r\n\r\nQuestion: If there are 10,772 people in cock city – or 12.3% of the total cities total population. \r\n\r\nHow do i do the calculations to find the total population of a cock city.  \r\n  \r\nA. It sounds like you meant:\r\n\r\n> 10,772 people = 12.3% of the total population.\r\n\r\nTo find the **total population**, you reverse the percentage calculation:\r\n\r\n\r\n**Step-by-step:**\r\n\r\n1. **Write the equation**:\r\n    10,772=12.3%×Total Population10,772 = 12.3\\% \\times \\text{Total Population}\r\n\r\n2. **Convert the percent to decimal**:\r\n    12\\.3%=0.12312.3\\% = 0.123\r\n\r\n3. **Divide both sides by 0.123**:\r\n    Total Population=10,7720.123\\text{Total Population} = \\frac{10,772}{0.123}\r\n\r\n4. **Do the division**:\r\n    Total Population=87,561.788...\\text{Total Population} = 87,561.788...\r\n\r\n## **Answer**✅: about **87,562 people** total.\r\n\r\n  \r\nIf you want, I can also show you a quick mental math shortcut for this kind of “percentage to total” problem.  \r\n  \r\nAlright — here’s the mental math shortcut for problems like:  \r\n“X people is Y% of the total — find total.”\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## **Shortcut Method**\r\n\r\nIf  \r\nPart=Percent×Total\\text{Part} = \\text{Percent} \\times \\text{Total}  \r\nthen  \r\nTotal=Part×100Percent\\text{Total} = \\frac{\\text{Part} \\times 100}{\\text{Percent}}\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFor your example:\r\n\r\n1. Multiply **10,772 × 100**\r\n    → 1,077,200\r\n\r\n2. Divide by **12\\.3**\r\n    - 12 × 7,300 ≈ 87,600 (close enough!)\r\n    - More precisely: 1,077,200 ÷ 12.3 ≈ **87,562**\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n💡 **Trick to speed it up**\r\n\r\n- Round the percent to something friendly (e.g., 12 instead of 12.3) to estimate.\r\n- Then adjust:\r\n    - If your rounded percent was *smaller* than the actual, your estimate will be *too big* — so shrink it slightly.\r\n    - If your rounded percent was *bigger*, bump your estimate up a bit.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you like, I can give you a **one-line “divide by percent” memory hack** so you can do this in your head without a calculator.\r\n\r\n## The one-liner you can keep in your head:\r\n\r\n**💡 “Move the decimal two places right, then divide by the percent number.”**\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFor your case:\r\n\r\n1. **Move decimal 2 places right** on 10,772 → **1,077,200**\r\n2. **Divide by the percent number** (12.3) → 87,562\r\n\r\nThat’s it.  \r\nIt works because “×100 ÷ percent” is exactly what the formula needs.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n",

To be explicit, just write it like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<http://someurl>\r\n\r\n<somebbob@example.com>\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n[http://someurl](http://someurl)\r\n\r\n[somebbob@example.com](mailto:somebbob@example.com)\r\n\r\nTo use text for the link, write it:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[like this](http://someurl)\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n[like this](http://someurl)\r\n\r\nYou can add a \\*title\\* (which shows up under the cursor):\r\n\r\n```\r\n[like this](http://someurl \"this title shows up when you hover\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n[like this](http://someurl \"this title shows up when you hover\")\r\n\r\n## Reference Links\r\n\r\n```\r\nYou can also put the [link URL][1] below the current paragraph\r\nlike [this][2].\r\n\r\n   [1]: http://url\r\n   [2]: http://another.url \"A funky title\"\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\nYou can also put the [link URL](http://url) below the current paragraph  \r\nlike [this](http://another.url \"A funky title\").\r\n\r\nHere the text \"link URL\" gets linked to \"http://url\", and the lines showing \"\\[1\\]: http://url\" won't show anything.\r\n\r\nOr you can use a \\[shortcut\\]\\[\\] reference, which links the text \"shortcut\" to the link named \"\\[shortcut\\]\" on the next paragraph.\r\n\r\n```\r\nOr you can use a [shortcut][] reference, which links the text\r\n\"shortcut\" to the link named \"[shortcut]\" on the next paragraph.\r\n\r\n[shortcut]: http://goes/with/the/link/name/text\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\nOr you can use a [shortcut](http://goes/with/the/link/name/text) reference, which links the text  \r\n\"shortcut\" to the link named \"\\[shortcut\\]\" on the next paragraph.\r\n\r\n## Artifact Links\r\n\r\nAny forge resource (artifact) can be linked with surrounding square brackets, e.g. \\[MyPage\\] or \\[#123\\]. These artifact links can take several forms.\r\n\r\n### Simple Links\r\n\r\nMost commonly, the artifact identifier can simply be surrounded with square brackets. Here are some examples:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[MyWikiPage]       # Wiki - name of wiki page\r\n[#123]             # Tracker - ticket number\r\n[r10721]           # SVN - revision number\r\n[3b9d48]           # Git & Mercurial - first 6 characters of revision hash\r\n[2012/02/my-post]  # Blog - post slug, including YYYY/MM/ prefix\r\n[a6d38f98]         # Discussion Thread - thread id\r\n[a6d38f98#42f8]    # Discussion Post - thread_id#post_id\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n### Two-part Links\r\n\r\nTo link to an artifact in a specific tool, use the form: \\`\\[tool:artifact\\]\\`, where \\`tool\\` is the name of the tool as it appears in the URL. Two-part links are useful when you have two tools of the same type installed. For example, let's say you have a 'bugs' tracker and a 'features' tracker installed, and you want to link to the first ticket in each:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[bugs:#1]\r\n[features:#1]\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n### Three-part Links\r\n\r\nTo link to an artifact in another project, use the form: \\`\\[project:tool:artifact\\]\\`, where \\`project\\` is the name of the project as it appears in the URL. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[allura:wiki:Home]\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nTo link to an artifact in a subproject, use the form: \\`\\[project/subproject:tool:artifact\\]\\`, where \\`subproject\\` is the name of the subproject as it appears in the URL. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[allura/sub:code:3b9d48]\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n## User Mentions\r\n\r\nAn user can be mentioned using @ sign and the username. A rendered user mention has a link to the particular user and also an info tip on mouse hover.\r\n\r\n```\r\n  @test-user-1       # Mention test-user-1\r\n  \r\n```\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n## Basic Text Formatting\r\n\r\nUse \\* or \\_ to emphasize things:\r\n\r\n```\r\n*this is in italic*  and _so is this_\r\n\r\n**this is in bold**  and __so is this__\r\n\r\n***this is bold and italic***  and ___so is this___\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n*this is in italic* and *so is this*\r\n\r\n**this is in bold** and **so is this**\r\n\r\n***this is bold and italic*** and ***so is this***\r\n\r\nYou can strike through text using HTML like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<s>this is strike through text</s>\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n~this is strike through text~\r\n\r\n```\r\nA carriage return\r\nmakes a line break.\r\n\r\nTwo carriage returns make a new paragraph.\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\nA carriage return  \r\nmakes a line break.\r\n\r\nTwo carriage returns make a new paragraph.\r\n\r\n## Blockquotes\r\n\r\nUse the > character in front of a line, *just like in email*\r\n\r\n```\r\n> Use it if you're quoting a person, a song or whatever.\r\n\r\n> You can use *italic* or lists inside them also.\r\nAnd just like with other paragraphs,\r\nall of these lines are still\r\npart of the blockquote, even without the > character in front.\r\n\r\nTo end the blockquote, just put a blank line before the following\r\nparagraph.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n> Use it if you're quoting a person, a song or whatever.\r\n> \r\n> You can use *italic* or lists inside them also.  \r\n> And just like with other paragraphs,  \r\n> all of these lines are still  \r\n> part of the blockquote, even without the > character in front.\r\n\r\nTo end the blockquote, just put a blank line before the following  \r\nparagraph.\r\n\r\n## Preformatted Text\r\n\r\nIf you want some text to show up exactly as you write it, without Markdown doing anything to it, just indent every line by at least 4 spaces (or 1 tab). As an alternative to indenting, you can make a code block use 3 or more tildes (~) or backticks (\\`) on a line before and after the text ([syntax details](https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/fenced_code_blocks/)). See examples in the [Code Highlighting section](https://sourceforge.net/nf/markdown_syntax#md_ex_code).\r\n\r\n```\r\n    This line won't *have any markdown* formatting applied.\r\n    I can even write <b>HTML</b> and it will show up as text.\r\n    This is great for showing program source code, or HTML or even\r\n    Markdown. <b>this won't show up as HTML</b> but\r\n    exactly <i>as you see it in this text file</i>.\r\n\r\nWithin a paragraph, you can use backquotes to do the same thing.\r\n`This won't be *italic* or **bold** at all.`\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n```\r\nThis line won't *have any markdown* formatting applied.\r\nI can even write <b>HTML</b> and it will show up as text.\r\nThis is great for showing program source code, or HTML or even\r\nMarkdown. <b>this won't show up as HTML</b> but\r\nexactly <i>as you see it in this text file</i>.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nWithin a paragraph, you can use backquotes to do the same thing.  \r\n`This won't be *italic* or **bold** at all.`\r\n\r\n## Lists\r\n\r\n```\r\n* an asterisk starts an unordered list\r\n* and this is another item in the list\r\n+ or you can also use the + character\r\n- or the - character\r\n\r\nTo start an ordered list, write this:\r\n\r\n1. this starts a list *with* numbers\r\n+  this will show as number \"2\"\r\n*  this will show as number \"3.\"\r\n9. any number, +, -, or * will keep the list going.\r\n    * just indent by 4 spaces (or tab) to make a sub-list\r\n        1. keep indenting for more sub lists\r\n    * here i'm back to the second level\r\n\r\nTo start a check list, write this:\r\n\r\n- [ ] this is not checked\r\n- [ ] this is too\r\n- [x] but this is checked\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n*   an asterisk starts an unordered list\r\n*   and this is another item in the list\r\n*   or you can also use the + character\r\n*   or the - character\r\n\r\nTo start an ordered list, write this:\r\n\r\n1.  this starts a list *with* numbers\r\n2.  this will show as number \"2\"\r\n3.  this will show as number \"3.\"\r\n4.  any number, +, -, or \\* will keep the list going.\r\n    *   just indent by 4 spaces (or tab) to make a sub-list\r\n        1.  keep indenting for more sub lists\r\n    *   here i'm back to the second level\r\n\r\nTo start a check list, write this:\r\n\r\n*   [ ]  this is not checked\r\n*   [ ]  this is too\r\n*   [x]  but this is checked\r\n\r\n## Tables\r\n\r\nYou can create tables using pipes and dashes like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  First Header  | Second Header\r\n  ------------- | -------------\r\n  Content Cell  | Content Cell\r\n  Content Cell  | Content Cell\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n| First Header | Second Header |\r\n| --- | --- |\r\n| Content Cell | Content Cell |\r\n| Content Cell | Content Cell |\r\n\r\nYou can use markdown syntax within table cells for formatting:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  First Header   | Second Header\r\n  -------------  | -------------\r\n  *Content Cell* | Content Cell\r\n  Content Cell   | Content Cell\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n| First Header | Second Header |\r\n| --- | --- |\r\n| *Content Cell* | Content Cell |\r\n| Content Cell | Content Cell |\r\n\r\nYou can also create tables using HTML code.\r\n\r\n## Headers\r\n\r\nJust put 1 or more dashes or equals signs (--- or ===) below the title.\r\n\r\n```\r\nThis is a huge header\r\n==================\r\n\r\nthis is a smaller header\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n# This is a huge header\r\n\r\n## this is a smaller header\r\n\r\n## Horizontal Rule\r\n\r\nJust put three or more \\*'s or -'s on a line:\r\n\r\n```\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOr, you can use single spaces between then, like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n* * *\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n```\r\n- - - - - - -\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nMake sure you have a blank line above the dashes, though, or else:\r\n\r\n```\r\nyou will get a header\r\n---\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n## you will get a header\r\n\r\n## Images\r\n\r\nTo include an image, just put a \"!\" in front of a text link:\r\n\r\n```\r\n![alternate text](https://a.fsdn.com/allura/nf/1748879481/_static_/images/up.png)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n![alternate text](https://a.fsdn.com/allura/nf/1748879481/_static_/images/up.png)\r\n\r\nThe \"alternate text\" will show up if the browser can't load the image.\r\n\r\nYou can also use a title if you want, like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n![small up arrow](https://a.fsdn.com/allura/nf/1748879481/_static_/images/up.png \"small up arrow\")\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n![small up arrow](https://a.fsdn.com/allura/nf/1748879481/_static_/images/up.png \"small up arrow\")\r\n\r\nTo reference an attached image, just use the img macro. You can add more attributes:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[[img src=attached-image.jpg alt=foobar]]\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Videos\r\n\r\nTo embed a YouTube video, use the `embed` macro (only YouTube is supported at this time):\r\n\r\n```\r\n[[embed url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YbBmqUnoQM]]\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n<iframe height=\"150\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6YbBmqUnoQM?feature=oembed\" title=\"Ein eigener &quot;SourceForge&quot; mit Allura\" width=\"200\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n## Escapes and HTML\r\n\r\nWhat if you want to just show asterisks, not italics?\r\n\r\n```\r\n* this shows up in italics: *a happy day*\r\n* this shows the asterisks: \\*a happy day\\*\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n*   this shows up in italics: *a happy day*\r\n*   this shows the asterisks: \\*a happy day\\*\r\n\r\nThe backslashes will disappear and leave the asterisks. You can do the same with any of the characters that have a special meaning  \r\nfor Markdown.\r\n\r\nMany simple HTML tags are allowed, for example <b> And unknown tags will be dropped. To show a literal <b> or an unknown tag like <foobar> you need escape it with HTML entities: :\r\n\r\n```\r\n<b>this will be bold</b>\r\nyou should escape &lt;unknown&gt; tags\r\n&copy; special entities work\r\n&amp;copy; if you want to escape it\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n**this will be bold**  \r\nyou should escape <unknown> tags  \r\n© special entities work  \r\n&copy; if you want to escape it\r\n\r\nHTML tags that are block-level like <div> can be used, but if there is markdown formatting within it, you must add a \"markdown\" attribute: <div markdown> Some safe attributes are also allowed, permitting basic styling and layout: <div markdown style=\"float:left\">\r\n\r\nIndividual ampersands (&) and less-than signs (<) are fine, they will be shown as expected.\r\n\r\n## More Headers\r\n\r\nMore ways of doing headers:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# this is a huge header #\r\n## this is a smaller header ##\r\n### this is even smaller ###\r\n#### more small ####\r\n##### even smaller #####\r\n###### smallest still: `<h6>` header\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n# this is a huge header\r\n\r\n## this is a smaller header\r\n\r\n### this is even smaller\r\n\r\n#### more small\r\n\r\n##### even smaller\r\n\r\n###### smallest still: `<h6>` header\r\n\r\nYou can use up to 6 `#` characters at the beginning of the line.\r\n\r\n## Table of Contents\r\n\r\nYou can display a list of links to jump to headers in a document. Sub-headers will be nested.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[TOC]\r\n\r\n# Section 1\r\n## Sub-section 1\r\n# Section 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n*   [Section 1](https://sourceforge.net/nf/markdown_syntax#section-1)\r\n    *   [Sub-section 1](https://sourceforge.net/nf/markdown_syntax#sub-section-1)\r\n*   [Section 2](https://sourceforge.net/nf/markdown_syntax#section-2)\r\n\r\n# Section 1\r\n\r\n## Sub-section 1\r\n\r\n# Section 2\r\n\r\n## Code Highlighting\r\n\r\nThe code highlighting syntax uses [CodeHilite](https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/code_hilite/) and is colored with [Pygments](https://pygments.org/). It follows the same syntax as regular Markdown [code blocks](https://sourceforge.net/nf/markdown_syntax#md_ex_pre), with ways to tell the highlighter what language to use for the code block.\r\n\r\nThe language will be detected automatically, if possible. Or you can specify it on the first line with 3 colons and the language name.\r\n\r\n```\r\n    :::python\r\n    import abc\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport abc\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the first line of the codeblock contains a shebang, the language is derived from that and line numbers are used. If shebang line contains a full path, it will be included in the output. If it does not contain a path (a single / or even a space), then that shebang line will be omitted from output.\r\n\r\n```\r\n    #!/usr/bin/python\r\n    import abc\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n<table class=\"codehilitetable\"><tbody><tr><td class=\"linenos\"><div class=\"linenodiv\"><pre><span class=\"normal\">1</span>\r\n<span class=\"normal\">2</span></pre></div></td><td class=\"code\"><div><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"ch\">#!/usr/bin/python</span>\r\n<span class=\"kn\">import</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nn\">abc</span>\r\n</code></pre></div></td></tr></tbody></table>\r\n\r\nIf using a code block of tildes or backticks, you can also specify the language on the first divider line\r\n\r\n```\r\n~~~html\r\n<a href=\"#\">My code</a>\r\n~~~\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n```html\r\n<a href=\"#\">My code</a>\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<a href=\"#\">My code</a>\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nMany languages are supported. See all the \"short names\" listed in the [Pygments docs](https://pygments.org/docs/lexers/).\r\n\r\n## Includes\r\n\r\nYou can embed another wiki page directly:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[[include ref=SamplePage]]\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nNo example output is available for this one because it only works on real wiki pages. Try it in your wiki!\r\n\r\nAlso, you can embed a file directly from a repository! Just skip the ref parameter and pass repository, path and optional revision:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[[include repo=code path=README]]\r\n\r\n[[include repo=myproject:code path=/ew/forms.py rev=fa61e7]]\r\n\r\n[[include repo=p:myproject:code path=/ew/forms.py]]\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nRepo could be specified in three ways:\r\n\r\n*   app\r\n*   project:app\r\n*   neighborhood:project:app\r\n\r\nWhere app is a repository's mount point, project is a project's shortname and neighborhood is a neighborhood's prefix that appears in url.\r\n\r\n## Neighborhood Notifications\r\n\r\nYou can list updates from all projects in a neighborhood by tool type. Max\\_number (default is 5) and sort (default is pubdate) are optional:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[[neighborhood_feeds tool_name=wiki max_number=10 sort=pubdate]]\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Neighborhood Blog Posts\r\n\r\nYou can view blog posts from all projects in a neighborhood. Max\\_number (default is 5) and sort (default is timestamp) are optional:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[[neighborhood_blog_posts max_number=10 sort=timestamp]]\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Project Blog Posts\r\n\r\nYou can view blog posts from all blogs in a project. Max\\_number (default is 5), mount point (leave empty to view posts from all blog tools in a project), and sort (default is timestamp) are optional:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[[project_blog_posts max_number=10 sort=timestamp mount_point=news]]\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Download Button\r\n\r\nYou can display a download button that links to the best download available for the active project. Please note that if you use this macro and there is no download associated with your project, the button will not appear.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[[download_button]]\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Project Member List\r\n\r\nYou can display a list of project members. By default the list is limited to 20 members, and a link is provided to a page with the full list.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[[members]]\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Project Screenshots\r\n\r\nYou can show all the screenshots for the current project as thumbnails that are linked to the full-size image.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[[project_screenshots]]\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Thanks",

I’ve tried two ways to edit Markdown files in the Sublime Text (ST) editor. One is to use MarkdownLivePreview + Markdown Extended to get split panels in the ST editor. One panel for the source text and another panel for the rendered content. The second way is to use MarkdownPreview + LiveReload to render in a browser with “live” reload. \r\n\r\n**Install the Relevant ST Plugins**\r\n\r\nTo install a package in ST, use `ctrl + shift + P` to open the command palette. Select `Package Control` Install Package and then select the relevant package (e.g., MarkdownPreview). \r\n\r\n- Packages to install:\r\n\t- MarkdownPreview\r\n\t- LiveReload\r\n\t- PackageResourceViewer\r\n\t- MarkdownLivePreview\r\n\t- Live Reloading on a Browser\r\n\r\nTo preview the markdown content on a browser, use `ctrl + shift + P` to open the command palette. Select `Markdown Preview`, Preview in Browser and then choose `markdown`.\r\n\r\nFor `live` reloading -- reloads on `ctrl + save` -- some additional steps are required. First, the `LiveReload` Sublime Text package is required. Install `LiveReload` and restart ST. Then open the command palette again and select `LiveReload`: Enable/disable plug-ins and choose Simple Reload with delay (400ms). The preview on the browser should now reload with every save.\r\n\r\n**Live Reloading in Sublime Text Editor**\r\n\r\nTo set up `live reload` in ST itself, install the `MarkdownLivePreview` + `Markdown Extended` packages. To start the preview panel, open command palette and select `MarkdownLivePreview`: Open Preview.

Instead of racing around the 3 Peaks in one day (with little enjoyment) join us for a more  leisurely circuit of each mountain by the best and most enjoyable route.\r\n\r\n13/14/15 May 2026\r\n\r\nThe cost for all 3 Guided Walks is £115\r\n\r\nThe itinerary for each day is detailed below although we are very flexible and things may change on the day (usually weather related). \r\n\r\nWe meet at 9.30 for each walk and will be out and about for roughly 6 hours.\r\nDay 1 (Wed). Pen-y-Ghent (Roughly 9 miles)\r\n\r\nFrom Horton-in-Ribblesdale we will follow the traditional route up Pen-y-Ghent. From the summit we will carry on towards Plovers Hill before dropping down to the old drovers road linking Littondale and Ribblesdale. The return takes us past Hull Pot, a waterfall as part of a collapsed limes.\r\nDay 2 (Thurs). Whernside (Roughly 11 miles)\r\n\r\nPark at Ribblehead and then follow the Settle Carlisle railway past the famous viaduct and Blea Moor Tunnel. From here leave the traditional route to enter the head of Dentdale and climb Whernside via 3 Tarns on its wide northern shoulder. From the summit drop back in to the head of Ribblesdale and return through Ribblehead viaduct.\r\nDay 3 (Fri). Ingleborough (Roughly 11 miles)\r\n\r\nStart at the lovely village of Clapham then climb Ingleborough via the dramatic Gaping Gill and Little Ingleborough. The plateau where the summit lies is a large flat boulder field with excellent views in all directions. The return to Clapham is via some of the most dramatic limestone pavements in England, the Ingleborough Nature Reserve.\r\n\r\nSettle or one of the surrounding villages is probably the best base for the walks. Settle is a market town with a good and varied choice of accommodation, places to eat and visit. There are also good rail links to Settle.\r\n\r\nHowever Ingleton, Long Preston and Horton are good as well.\r\n\r\nWe can easily arrange a pick up from Settle or nearby for each walk if you do not have your own car.\r\nSuggested Accommodation\r\n\r\nThe selection below are places which previous people on the walks have stayed in and enjoyed.\r\n\r\nGolden Lion, Settle\r\n\r\nCraven Arms, Settle\r\n\r\nHarts Head, Giggleswick\r\n\r\nMaypole Inn, Long Preston\r\n\r\nStation Inn, Ribblehead\r\n\r\nKing William IV Guest House, Settle\r\n\r\nDalesbridge Campsite\r\n\r\nKnights Table Campsite, Stainforth\r\n\r\nDo contact me if you are struggling to find accommodation. Midweek should be ok!\r\n",

It expands to the previous cmd.\r\n\r\n**12. Run Cmds Without Logging to Histroy**  \r\nStart the cmd with a **`space`**\r\n\r\n**11 Use Argument From the Previous Cmd**  \r\nUse **`Alt+.`** and it will insert the last argument from previous cmd\r\n\r\n\r\n**10. Replace a Word With Another in Previous Cmd**  \r\nYou've mistyped. Instead of retyping the entire cmd, use correction tool, the caret **`(^)`**symbol.  Let’s say you meant to type **`ping google.com`**, but typed **`ping goggle.com`** mistakenly. Just do: **`^goggle^google`** Bash will run **`ping google.com`**\r\n\r\n**9 Swap Characters Before and After the Cursor**  \r\nMisspelt a word? Just hit **`Ctrl+T`**. It swaps the two characters right around your cursor. Say you typed: **`grpe file.tx`t** but you meant **`grep`**. Just place the cursor on the **`p`**, hit **`Ctrl+T`**, and it becomes **`grep file.txt`** \r\n\r\n\r\n**8. Using Aliases**  \r\nLet’s face it. Some Linux commands are just long. And when you're running them often, typing the same flags or full paths gets irritating. Not to mention error-prone. That’s where [aliases](https://www.howtogeek.com/why-you-should-be-using-aliases-in-the-linux-terminal/) come in. They allow you to create your own command shortcuts, using simple names for more complex or frequently used commands.\r\n\r\nCreating an alias is as simple as:\r\n\r\n```\r\nalias shortname='actual command here'\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet’s say you’re always running:\r\n\r\n```\r\nls -lah --color=auto\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can quickly create an alias like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nalias ll='ls -lah --color=auto'\r\n```\r\n\r\n    ![An example of using command aliases on Linux.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/an-example-of-using-command-aliases-on-linux.png)\r\n\r\n[✕ Remove Ads](https://www.howtogeek.com/premium/?ref=ad_removal)\r\n\r\ngoogletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1528733612385-eer-REPEAT4'); });\r\n\r\nNow you can just run `ll` on the terminal to do the whole thing. Note that this will only be valid for the current terminal session. If you want to create a permanent alias, you'll have to add it to the ~/.bashrc file and reload it.\r\n\r\n**7 Format Your Output in Columns**\r\n\r\nOn Linux, we often need to work with data in the command line. Sometimes, the output can be quite messy. Luckily, we have the column command. It can turn that chaos into clean, readable tables of data. The column command formats text into neat columns, aligning things nicely based on whitespace or a custom delimiter. It's perfect when you're dealing with data like lists, CSV, colon-separated data, etc.\r\n\r\nLet's see a common example. We can normally list the processes on Linux with:\r\n\r\n```\r\nps aux\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can format it further using the column command:\r\n\r\n```\r\nps aux | head -10 | column -t\r\n```\r\n\r\n    ![An example of using the column command to format Linux command output.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/an-example-of-using-the-column-command-to-format-linux-command-output.png)\r\n\r\n[✕ Remove Ads](https://www.howtogeek.com/premium/?ref=ad_removal)\r\n\r\ngoogletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1528733612385-eer-REPEAT5'); });\r\n\r\nThis tells column to create a table with aligned columns. When using this command, it's best if you have predictable input. If your data is wildly inconsistent, the output might still look a bit rough. Moreover, if your delimiter appears in values, it might throw off the formatting.\r\n\r\n**6 Run Multiple Cmds Consecutively**\r\n\r\nSometimes you want to run several commands back to back. Instead of typing them one at a time and waiting, you can chain them together on a single line. Then, control whether they run unconditionally or only if the previous one succeeds.\r\n\r\nThe semicolon (;) lets you chain commands so they run one after the other, regardless of success or failure.\r\n\r\n```\r\necho \"Updating...\" ; sudo apt update ; echo \"Done!\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n    ![Running multiple Linux commands seperated by semicolons.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/running-multiple-linux-commands-seperated-by-semicolons.png)\r\n\r\nIn this example, even if **apt update** fails, the final **echo \"Done!\"** still runs.\r\n\r\nThe && operator, on the other hand, ensures that each command only runs if the one before it succeeds. This is a smarter way to chain commands.\r\n\r\n[✕ Remove Ads](https://www.howtogeek.com/premium/?ref=ad_removal)\r\n\r\ngoogletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1528733612385-eer-REPEAT6'); });\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe command after && will only run if the command before it runs successfully. The opposite of && is the || (two vertical bars) operator. When two commands are combined using this symbol, the command on the right will execute only if the command on the left fails. Using && and || helps you debug issues with your [Bash scripts](https://www.howtogeek.com/808593/bash-script-examples/).\r\n\r\n    [![A hand using a laptop and Linux mascot coming out of the screen with a gear and some files behind.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/a-hand-using-a-laptop-and-linux-mascot-coming-out-of-the-screen-with-a-gear-and-some-files-behind.jpg)](https://www.howtogeek.com/ways-to-configure-linux-command-line-tools/)Related\r\n\r\n##### [5 Ways to Make Linux Commands Work the Way You Want](https://www.howtogeek.com/ways-to-configure-linux-command-line-tools/ \"5 Ways to Make Linux Commands Work the Way You Want\")\r\n\r\nYou don't really know the full power of Linux until you can tweak your toolset.\r\n\r\nPosts [2](https://www.howtogeek.com/ways-to-configure-linux-command-line-tools/#threads \"Total Posts\")\r\n\r\n\r\n**4 Go to the Previous Directory**\r\n\r\nI often find myself jumping back and forth between two directories. Typing the full path repeatedly is annoying. So this neat little trick was a lifesaver for me:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncd -\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis command sends you to the previous working directory, just like a back button in your [Linux file system](https://www.howtogeek.com/117435/htg-explains-the-linux-directory-structure-explained/). Let’s say you start in:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/home/user/projects/website\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen you go to \"~/Downloads.\" Now, if you run the **cd -** command, you’re instantly back in \"/home/user/projects/website.\" And if you run cd - again, you go back to \"~/Downloads.\"\r\n\r\n[✕ Remove Ads](https://www.howtogeek.com/premium/?ref=ad_removal)\r\n\r\ngoogletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1528733612385-eer-REPEAT8'); });\r\n\r\n    ![Using the cd - command to jump between two directories.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/using-the-cd-command-to-jump-between-two-directories.png)\r\n\r\n**3 Freeze Unfreeze Your Terminal**\r\n\r\nIf you’ve ever hit Ctrl+S in a terminal out of habit, trying to save something, you may have found your terminal to be stuck. Don't worry. Your system didn't crash. Your keyboard isn’t broken either. In the Linux terminal, Ctrl+S sends a software flow control signal called XOFF. This tells the terminal to pause output, effectively freezing it.\r\n\r\nTo unfreeze the terminal, simply hit Ctrl+Q. This sends XON, the resume output signal, and unfreezes your terminal instantly.\r\n\r\nBut why does this even exist? It’s a legacy feature from when terminals communicated over slow serial lines. It allowed you to pause scrolling text before it overflowed the screen. But nowadays, it’s mostly just a trap for people trying to save something or type fast.\r\n\r\n**2 Clear the Terminal Screen**\r\n\r\nYou’re deep into a terminal session, the screen is filled with output from commands, logs, error messages, or whatever mess you just created. You could scroll, or manually type \"clear.\" But there's a faster way. Just hit Ctrl+L. This will clean your terminal screen instantly.\r\n\r\nThe difference between using the clear command and this shortcut is that, if you use the clear command, you won't be able to scroll up and see the previous commands. If you use Ctrl+L, then you can still scroll up to see the previous commands you issued, which can be useful.\r\n\r\n    [![Linux Laptop with a terminal open.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/linux-laptop-with-a-terminal-open.jpg)](https://www.howtogeek.com/these-linux-commands-showed-me-how-much-better-life-is-off-windows/)Related\r\n\r\n##### [These 10 Linux Commands Showed Me How Much Better Life Is Off Windows](https://www.howtogeek.com/these-linux-commands-showed-me-how-much-better-life-is-off-windows/ \"These 10 Linux Commands Showed Me How Much Better Life Is Off Windows\")\r\n\r\nLife's better off Windows—and Linux is ready to prove it.\r\n\r\n**1 Create Nested Directories**\r\n\r\nSay you're starting a project and you need to create multiple directories, one inside the other. Creating each parent directory and then the subdirectories is quite cumbersome. Instead, consider using the -p flag in the mkdir command. This allows you to create subdirectories inside the parent directories using a single command.\r\n\r\n```\r\nmkdir -p rootfolder/client/components\r\n```\r\n\r\n    ![Making nested directories on Linux.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/making-nested-directories-on-linux.png)\r\n\r\nNow, suppose you want to [create multiple subdirectories](https://www.howtogeek.com/275069/how-to-create-multiple-subdirectories-with-one-linux-command/) under one directory. You can do that by wrapping the subdirectories in curly braces.\r\n\r\n```\r\nmkdir -p rootfolder/{client/components,server}\r\n```\r\n\r\n    ![Making multiple subdirectories under one directory on Linux.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/making-multiple-subdirectories-under-one-directory-on-linux.png)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThere are many more tricks that make [learning the Linux terminal](https://www.howtogeek.com/tricks-to-make-learning-the-linux-command-line-easier/) worth it.",

      "content": "Take Silent Screenshots in XFCE ✓\r\n\r\nTo use shell features like variable expansion or command substitution in an XFCE keyboard shortcut (for example, to save screenshots with a timestamped filename), you need to wrap your command with **`sh -c`**. This is because XFCE shortcuts do not invoke a shell by default, so things like **`$(date ...)`** won't work unless explicitly run in a shell context.\r\n\r\nHere’s an example command that takes a fullscreen screenshot, includes the mouse pointer, and saves it to your Pictures/Screenshots folder with a timestamped filename (including milliseconds to avoid overwriting):\r\n\r\n```\r\nsh -c 'xfce4-screenshooter -f -m -s \"$HOME/Pictures/Screenshots/Screenshot_$(date \"+%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M-%S-%3N\").png\"'\r\n```\r\nThis command can be set as a keyboard shortcut in XFCE and will run silently—no dialog or popup will appear, and the screenshot will be saved automatically with the desired filename[6].\r\n\r\n- **`sh -c`** starts a shell session to interpret the command string.\r\n- Everything inside the single quotes is run by the shell, so **`$HOME`** and **`$(date ...)`** are expanded properly.\r\n- The **`-f`** flag means fullscreen, **`-m`** includes the mouse pointer, and **`-s`** specifies the save path.\r\n\r\nYou can adjust the options as needed (e.g., use **`-w`** for window, **`-r`** for region, etc.)[1][4].\r\n\r\n**Tip:** If you want to ensure absolutely no notification or popup, make sure not to use flags like **`--show`** or **`--open`**.

However, there are a couple of things to note:\r\n\r\n1. **Quoting**: The use of single quotes around `*.zip` means that the shell will not expand the wildcard to match files. You should use double quotes or no quotes at all.\r\n\r\n2. **Command**: The `unzip` command is used to extract files from a ZIP archive.\r\n\r\nHere’s a corrected version of your function:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nfunction uza() { unzip *.zip; }\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr, if you want to ensure it works even if there are no `.zip` files (to avoid an error), you can use:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nfunction uza() { unzip '*.zip' 2>/dev/null; }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will suppress error messages if there are no `.zip` files to unzip. \r\n\r\nYou can add this function to your shell configuration file (like `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`) to make it available in your terminal sessions. After adding it, remember to source the file or restart your terminal.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n",

Decide on the Command**\r\n\r\nYou want a command that creates a new empty file (for example, in your `~/Documents` folder) and opens it in Pluma. Here’s a suitable command:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\npluma \"$(mktemp ~/Documents/Untitled_XXXXXX.txt)\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n- `mktemp ~/Documents/Untitled_XXXXXX.txt` creates a unique named empty file in your Doc folder.\r\n- `pluma ...` opens that file in Pluma.\r\n\r\n**2. Add the Shortcut in Your Desktop Environment**\r\n\r\nFor Xfce:\r\n\r\n- Go to **Settings > Keyboard > Application Shortcuts**.\r\n- Click **Add**, paste the command, and set your key.\r\n\r\n**3. Test the Shortcut**\r\n\r\nPress your chosen key combination. Pluma should open a new, uniquely named empty document in your Documents folder.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Note:**  \r\n- The shortcut setup interface may vary slightly by desktop environment, but the process is similar[3][4][5].\r\n- The command uses `mktemp` to avoid overwriting existing files and to ensure each new document is unique.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you want the file to always have the same name (and be overwritten), use:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ntouch ~/Documents/Untitled.txt && pluma ~/Documents/Untitled.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut using `mktemp` is safer for multiple new documents.\r\n\r\n[1] https://ubuntu-mate.community/t/key-bindings-in-pluma/26895\r\n[2] https://dwaves.de/2024/03/10/gnu-linux-pluma-text-editor-and-mate-desktop-hotkeys-shortcuts/\r\n[3] https://ubuntu-mate.community/t/pluma-text-wrapping-shortcut/10099\r\n[4] https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=229966\r\n[5] https://www.reddit.com/r/linux4noobs/comments/mo0gnm/create_keyboard_shortcuts_on_linux/\r\n[6] https://github.com/mate-desktop/pluma/issues/181\r\n[7] https://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?t=236540\r\n[8] https://askubuntu.com/questions/1302829/how-do-i-select-the-text-on-pluma-app-from-cursor-position-to-the-end-beginning",

While humorous, this statement holds truth—while we celebrate butterflies, we often neglect moths.\r\n\r\nPhysiologically, there’s little difference between the two, aside from the butterfly’s distinctive clubbed antennae. Both share the same lifecycle: egg, caterpillar, chrysalis, and adult.\r\n\r\n**Read more** *[The Secret Life of Moths](https://www.countrylife.co.uk/country-life/secret-life-moths-90723)*\r\n\r\n### Garden Tiger *(Arctia caja)*   \r\n![Garden Tiger](https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/06/garden-tiger-300x191.jpg)\r\n\r\nIf the distinctive garden tiger is a species you remember from childhood but haven’t seen in a while, you’re not alone. The charity Butterfly Conservation reports a 92% decline in this species over the past 40 years, likely due to the detrimental effects of milder, wetter winters on caterpillar survival.\r\n\r\n### Death’s-head Hawk-moth *(Acherontia atropos)*\r\n\r\n![Death’s-head Hawk-moth](https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/06/death-hawk-head-moth-300x191.jpg)  \r\n\r\nThe ultimate prize for moth-trappers, the giant death’s-head hawk-moth (with a wingspan of nearly 5 inches) is a tropical African species that occasionally vagrants to northern Europe. Its distinctive skull on the thorax and ability to emit high-pitched squeaks contribute to its reputation as a bad omen.\r\n\r\n### Narrow-bordered Bee Hawk-moth *(Hemaris tityus)*\r\n\r\n![Narrow-bordered Bee Hawk-moth](https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/06/narrow-bordered-bee-300x191.jpg)  \r\n\r\nThis day-flying moth closely mimics a bumblebee, but its faster and more agile flight allows it to skim from bloom to bloom in flower-rich meadows. Once widespread, it has declined due to the loss of unimproved pastures and chalk downland.\r\n\r\n### Silver Y *(Autographa gamma)*\r\n\r\n![Silver Y](https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/06/silver-Y-300x191.jpg)  \r\n\r\nThe most common migrant moth, easily identified by the distinctive metallic Y on each forewing. In some years, it arrives in southern England in large numbers, often alongside painted lady butterflies. Although chiefly crepuscular, newly arrived Silver Y moths will feed during the day.\r\n\r\n### Black Arches *(Lymantria monacha)*\r\n\r\n![Black Arches](https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/06/black-arches-300x191.jpg)  \r\n\r\nThis attractive black-and-white moth is widely distributed in the oak woods of southern England, where it is not generally considered a problem. However, on the Continent, its caterpillars consume pine needles, leading to major infestations that can kill pine trees.\r\n\r\n### Hummingbird Hawk-moth *(Macroglossum stellatarum)*\r\n\r\n![Hummingbird Hawk-moth](https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/06/hummingbird-hawk-moth-300x191.jpg)  \r\n\r\nNo moth is more aptly named. A migrant to the British Isles, it arrives in variable numbers each summer, feeding by day on nectar-rich flowers like jasmine, buddleia, phlox, and nicotiana, hovering in front of blooms to sip nectar.\r\n\r\n### Fox *(Macrothylacia rubi)*\r\n\r\n![Fox](https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/06/fox-moth-300x191.jpg)  \r\n\r\nThe nocturnal, grey-brown female is seldom seen, while the foxy-red-brown male undertakes late-afternoon flights over heathland in search of a mate. Their flight is powerful, erratic, and typically just above the ground.\r\n\r\n### Lunar Hornet *(Sesia bembeciformis)*\r\n\r\n![Lunar Hornet](https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/06/lunar-hornet-300x191.jpg)  \r\n\r\nFew moths mimic other species as well as the lunar hornet moth, which resembles a large hornet and emits a menacing hornet-like buzz. Note the absence of the wasp’s distinctive waist between the abdomen and thorax.\r\n\r\n### Six-spot Burnet *(Zygaena filipendulae)*\r\n\r\n![Six-spot Burnet](https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/06/six-spot-burnet-300x191.jpg)  \r\n\r\nThis familiar species is commonly found throughout the British Isles, though in the North, it is restricted to the coast. A day-flyer, it is most often seen in sunny weather and is the only one of six closely related UK species with six red (occasionally yellow) spots.\r\n\r\n### Latticed Heath *(Chiasmia clathrata)*\r\n\r\n![Latticed Heath](https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/06/latticed-heath-300x191.jpg)  \r\n\r\nThis moth is equally comfortable flying by day or night. A common and wide-ranging species, its coloration varies from white to yellowish. Its habit of folding its wings vertically over its back can lead to misidentification as a butterfly.\r\n\r\n### Emperor *(Saturnia pavonia)*\r\n\r\n![Emperor](https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/06/emperor-300x191.jpg)  \r\n\r\nArguably the most beautiful moth, the butterfly-like emperor is widespread throughout the British Isles. Fast-flying males are often seen by day, using their remarkable sense of smell and complex antennae to locate mates from a mile away, while females fly only at night.\r\n\r\n### Mottled Beauty *(Alcis repandata)*\r\n\r\n![Mottled Beauty](https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/06/mottled-beauty-300x191.jpg)  \r\n\r\nFew insects take camouflage to such extremes as the mottled beauty, whose coloring varies by region to suit its background. A common and widespread species, it flies in June and July, often in woodlands and suburban gardens, where it is frequently overlooked.\r\n\r\n### Peppered *(Biston betularia)*\r\n\r\n![Peppered Moth](https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/06/peppered-300x191.jpg)  \r\n\r\nFamous for demonstrating evolution in action, the melanic form of this species was first found in Manchester in 1848. Within about 50 years, it made up 98% of the local population due to its effective camouflage against soot-blackened trees. The normal salt-and-pepper coloring provides excellent protection in more typical conditions.\r\n\r\n### Speckled Yellow *(Pseudopanthera macularia)*\r\n\r\n![Speckled Yellow](https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/06/speckled-yellow-300x191.jpg)  \r\n\r\nThis sun-loving species is often encountered in woodlands during May and June and is frequently mistaken for a butterfly. The coloration and extent of the brown blotches vary, but there are no similar moths to confuse it with. It is common in southern England and occurs as far north as central and western Scotland.\r\n\r\n### Angle Shades *(Phlogophora meticulosa)*\r\n\r\n![Angle Shades](https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/06/angle-shade-300x191.jpg)  \r\n\r\nThe delicately scalloped wings of the angle shades make it one of the easiest moths to identify. Widely distributed throughout the British Isles, it is most common in the South, where it can be seen in every month. Its caterpillars feed on a wide variety of plants, making it a frequent visitor to gardens.\r\n\r\n### Spring Usher *(Agriopis leucophaearia)*\r\n\r\n![Spring Usher](https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/06/spring-usher-300x191.jpg)  \r\n\r\nOne of the first moths of the year, it can appear as early as January. Males fly to the wingless females. The leaf-green coloring of the caterpillar matches the young oak leaves on which it feeds, but many are preyed upon by tits and other birds.\r\n\r\n### Red Underwing *(Catocala nupta)*\r\n\r\n![Red Underwing](https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/06/red-underwing-300x191.jpg)  \r\n\r\nAt rest, with its hindwings hidden, this large moth is perfectly camouflaged. However, when disturbed, it flashes its vivid hindwings to startle predators. It is quite common in the southern half of Britain and is extending its range north, often found in gardens during August and September.\r\n\r\n### Kentish Glory *(Endromis versicolora)*\r\n\r\n![Kentish Glory](https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/06/kentish-glory-300x191.jpg)  \r\n\r\nThe name can be misleading, as this beautifully marked species was lost from Kent in 1868 and is now restricted to the Scottish Highlands. Understanding its specialist requirements (it needs regenerating birch saplings) supports the case for reintroducing it to sites where it once thrived.\r\n\r\n### Elephant Hawk-moth *(Deilephila elpenor)*\r\n\r\n![Elephant Hawk-moth](https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/06/elephant-hawk-moth-300x191.jpg)\r\n\r\nThis exquisitely beautiful species, with its crimson blush, is a common resident throughout the British Isles. In gardens, its caterpillars are often found on fuchsias. Adults rarely fly until well after dark but are strongly attracted to light. The name comes from the caterpillar’s distinctive trunk-like snout.\r\n\r\n### Cinnabar *(Tyria jacobaeae)*  \r\n\r\n![Cinnabar](https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/06/cinnabar-300x191.jpg)  \r\n\r\nEasily disturbed during the day, the flashing crimson underwings of the cinnabar serve as a warning to predators that it is toxic\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n",

      "content": "List and Filter Fonts With 'fc-list'  ✓\r\n\r\n**fc-list | grep**\r\n\r\nThe command `fc-list | grep` is used in a Unix-like operating system to list available fonts and filter the output based on a specific search term.\r\n\r\nHere's a breakdown of the command:\r\n\r\n1. **`fc-list`**: This command lists all the fonts available on the system. It provides details about each font, including its file path and other metadata.\r\n\r\n2. **`|`**:  is a pipe operator that takes the output of the command on its left (`fc-list`) and uses it as the input for the command on its right (`grep`).\r\n\r\n3. **`grep`**: This command is used to search for specific patterns in the input it receives. However, in this case, the command is incomplete because `grep` requires a search term or pattern to filter the output.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you wanted to find all fonts that contain the word \"Arial,\" you would use the cmd like this:  \r\n\r\n`fc-list | grep Arial`\r\n\r\nThis would list all the fonts that include \"Arial\" in their names or paths. Without a search term, the command as it stands will not produce any meaningful output.\r\n\r\n**fc-list Options**  \r\n\r\n1. **Filtering by Pattern**: You can specify a pattern to filter the fonts listed. For example:\r\n   \r\n   `fc-list : family | grep Arial`  \r\n   This would list only the font families that match \"Arial.\"\r\n\r\n2. **Output Formatting**: You can customize the output format using the `:` syntax. For example:\r\n   `fc-list : family, style`  \r\n   This command will list the font families along with their styles.\r\n\r\n3. **Specifying a Directory**: You can limit the search to a specific directory containing font files:\r\n  `fc-list /path/to/fonts`\r\n\r\n4. **Listing Font Properties**: List specific properties of fonts, like family, style, file path. For example:\r\n   `fc-list : family, style, file`\r\n\r\n5. **Using Environment Variables**: You can set environment variables to influence the behavior of `fc-list`, such as `FONTPATH`, which specifies additional directories to search for fonts.\r\n\r\n6. **Check Font Presence**: Without displaying the entire font list (or any pattern) using fc-list in Bash \r\n    `fc-list | grep -q \"Arabic\" && echo \"Font is present.\" || echo \"Font is not present.\"`\r\n\r\n    💡Tip:  You can condense the below multi line bash cmd, into a single line bash cmd like above using the **`&&`** and **`||`** operators, known as Logical Operators used to combine conditions  \r\n\r\n    ```bash\r\n    if fc-list | grep -q \"Arabic\"; then\r\n  echo \"Font is present.\"\r\nelse\r\n  echo \"Font is not present.\"\r\nfi\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile `fc-list` is focused on font management, its options allow for a variety of ways to query and display font information, making it a versatile tool for working with fonts on a system. However, it does not perform functions unrelated to font management.\r\n\r\n",

      "content": "Guide To 10 Common Caterpillars ✓\r\n\r\nIf you gain a reputation as a naturalist, it’s an odds-on certainty that, sooner or later, a neighbour’s child will arrive on your doorstep clutching a jam jar containing a monster of a caterpillar that you will be asked to identify.\r\n\r\nThis is usually rather straightforward, as most giant mystery caterpillars turn out to be the offspring of the elephant hawk-moth. Not only are they common and widespread, but they also have a startling appearance. When the caterpillar is alarmed, it retracts its head into its body, its front segments swell and its eye-spots become so prominent that it resembles a small snake, which scares off most predators and fascinates most small children.\r\n\r\n**Caterpillars are part of the four-stage lifecycle of every butterfly and moth: egg, caterpillar, pupa and adult.** The caterpillar is the growing stage in the insect’s life and it will moult several times to enable its body to expand. The stage between each moult is called an instar and most species undergo this process four to six times. Some caterpillars pupate within weeks of hatching and others overwinter, but, frustratingly, few are as easy to identify as that of the elephant hawk-moth\r\n\r\n**Pine Processionary Moth Caterpillar**\r\n\r\n![image](https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2015/05/pine-processionary-moth-caterpillar-correct.jpg)\r\n\r\n**1in, brown and black**  \r\nNot yet established in the UK, this is a moth that is moving steadily north through Europe and may well start breeding here. It will be an unwelcome immigrant, for this Mediterranean species is a major pest, its caterpillars able to strip a pine tree of its needles. The obvious signs of this moth’s presence are the conspicuous communal nests in which the caterpillars remain all winter. Once the weather warms up, the caterpillars emerge, moving in processions, head to tail. **They’re not to be touched** as their hairs are highly irritating and can cause a painful rash.\r\n\r\n**Garden Tiger Moth Caterpillar**\r\n\r\n![image](https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2015/05/garden-tiger-moth-caterpillar.jpg)  \r\n\r\n**2 ¼in, mainly black**   \r\nWith its dramatic warning colours - black and white forewings and scarlet rear wings - the garden tiger is one of the most familiar and easily identifiable moths. Its handsome, hairy caterpillar is equally distinctive, if less colourful. It sports dense tufts of hairs that grow from small raised warts and has a shining black head. Most gardeners know it as the woolly bear and, as it’s not fussy, it can be found feeding on almost any low-growing plant. Although these caterpillars hatch in July, they go into hibernation when they’re still quite small and complete their growth the following spring.\r\n\r\n**Swallowtail Butterfly Caterpillar**\r\n\r\n![image](https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2015/05/swallowtail-butterfly-caterpillar.jpg)\r\n\r\n**1 ½in, green with black bands** \r\nTo see the caterpillars of the swallowtail, you have to go to the Norfolk Broads in mid summer and search the leaves of milk parsley. Until their third moult, the caterpillars resemble small bird droppings, so are difficult to find, but the mature caterpillar is much easier to spot. It’s a handsome creature, with a green body with transverse black bands, the latter spotted with red. When alarmed, the caterpillar flicks out a pair of orange scent glands from behind the head, emitting a strong smell, but that’s not sufficient to deter reed buntings and sedge warblers, both of which are major predators.\r\n\r\n**Large or Cabbage White Butterfly Caterpillar**\r\n\r\n![image](https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2015/05/large-or-cabbage-white-butterfly-caterpillar.jpg)  \r\n\r\n**½in pale green and spotted with black** \r\nSecond only to the slug as the gardener’s enemy, the caterpillars of the large white butterfly are specialist eaters of brassicas. At first, the young caterpillars concentrate on the outer leaves, nipping holes between the veins, until, eventually, only a skeleton remains. They feed in unison, being stimulated to eat by the oily fumes from the damaged  leaves. They may look vulnerable to hungry birds, but their bodies accumulate poisonous oils of mustard gas that deter most predators. However, a parasitic wasp called [Cotesia glomerata](https://butterfly-conservation.org/news-and-blog/beware-of-zombies) lays its eggs in the caterpillars, eventually killing up to 80% of the population.\r\n\r\n**Comma Butterfly Caterpillar**\r\n\r\n![image](https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2015/05/comma-butterfly-caterpillar.jpg)\r\n\r\n**1-1⅓in black and brown**   \r\nJust as the adult comma is a master of camouflage, resembling, when at rest, a tattered leaf, so its caterpillar is equally adept at disguise. After each shedding of the skin, the caterpillar looks increasingly like a bird dropping. When fully mature, it’s tan, with a bright splash of white. There are two generations a year, so caterpillars can be found (usually on nettles) in May/June and again in September. Some of the first generation will be golden adults that will breed that summer; others will be dark specimens that will hibernate, emerging the following spring.\r\n\r\n**Elephant Hawk Moth Caterpillar**\r\n\r\n![image](https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2015/05/elephant-hawk-moth-caterpillar.jpg)  \r\n\r\n**3 ½in, green or brown**   \r\nAll the hawk-moths have interesting caterpillars, but few are as impressive as the elephant. The caterpillars can be found from July to September, usually on rosebay willowherb, but often on fuschia or honeysuckle. The two pairs of eye-spots that are such a prominent feature are extremely realistic and they remain bright until pupation. Like most hawk-moths, the caterpillar also sports a so-called horn on the tip of the end body segment. The moth’s name comes from the caterpillar’s supposed resemblance to an elephant’s trunk: most people think it looks more like a serpent.\r\n\r\n**Peacock Butterfly Caterpillar**\r\n\r\n![image](https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2015/05/peacock-butterfly-caterpillar.jpg)  \r\n\r\n**1 ½in, black spotted with white**   \r\nFemale peacocks lay their eggs in sticky piles on large and vigorous stinging nettles, over the tips of which, after hatching, the caterpillars spin a communal web. New webs are spun once the leaves have been eaten until, eventually, the large black caterpillars emerge to live in the open. Once they’re on the loose, the spines on their bodies help to protect them from predators and the caterpillars, which jerk their heads, move their bodies in unison. The first caterpillars are usually seen in May, but most emerge in June, when many are quickly gobbled up by parasitic wasps.\r\n\r\n**Emperor Moth Caterpillar**  \r\n\r\n![image](https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2015/05/emperor-moth-caterpillar.jpg)  \r\n\r\n**2 ¼in, dark or yellowish-green**  \r\nThe emperor is everybody’s favourite moth: it’s big and beautiful. So, too, is the mature caterpillar, with its dark or yellowish-green body with transverse bands of black. Its spiracles (external openings that allow oxygen into the body) are bright orange, rimmed with black. The favoured food plant is heather, but brambles, blackthorn and hawthorn are also devoured. The caterpillars can be found from May to August, eventually spinning a large cocoon from which the moth will emerge the next spring. The male emperor is renowned for being able to locate a female by scent, even over long distances.\r\n\r\n**Large Blue Butterfly Caterpillar**\r\n\r\n![image](https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2015/05/large-blue-butterfly-caterpillar.jpg)  \r\n\r\n**½in, ochreous white**  \r\nNo caterpillar has a more bizarre life than this. After hatching, the young caterpillar feeds on thyme, but by the time it’s reached its last instar (in just two or three weeks), it has developed a minute honey- gland. For red ants, this is the nectar of the gods - they find it irresistible. They milk the caterpillar and eventually adopt it and take it into their underground nest. Once inside the nest, the caterpillar preys on the grubs, eating as many as 1,200 of them and increasing its own weight 100 times by the time it pupates in late May.\r\n\r\n**Cinnabar Moth Caterpillar**\r\n\r\n![image](https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2015/05/cinnabar-moth-caterpillar.jpg)  \r\n\r\n**1in, orange-yellow with black stripes** \r\nWith its yellow-and-black-striped body, the cinnabar moth’s caterpillar looks as if it’s wearing a rugby jersey. It’s a warning colour, as the caterpillar, like the adult moth, is distasteful to birds. These caterpillars are ragwort specialists and play an important role in controlling this most hated of our native flowering plants, gaining their toxicity from the poisonous alkaloids sequestered from ragwort. Rapacious eaters, they will even turn cannibal if hungry. The day-flying cinnabar moth is one of 30 insect species entirely dependent on ragwort.\r\n\r\n",

      "content": "Verbs Adverbs and Adjectives ✓\r\n\r\nVerbs and adverbs are two different parts of speech that serve distinct roles in a sentence. Here's a breakdown of each:\r\n\r\n**Verbs**\r\n- **Definition:** Verbs are words that express action, occurrence, or a state of being.\r\n- **Examples:**\r\n  - **Action:** run, write, jump\r\n  - **Occurrence:** happen, become, change\r\n  - **State of Being:** is, seem, exist\r\n- **Usage in a Sentence:**\r\n  - \"She *runs* every morning.\" (action)\r\n  - \"They *became* friends quickly.\" (occurrence)\r\n  - \"He *is* excited about the trip.\" (state of being)\r\n\r\n**Adverbs**\r\n- **Definition:** Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, other adverbs, or entire sentences. They often provide additional context such as manner, time, frequency, degree, or place.\r\n- **Examples:**\r\n  - **Manner:** quickly, slowly, carefully\r\n  - **Time:** now, yesterday, soon\r\n  - **Frequency:** often, rarely, always\r\n  - **Degree:** very, quite, almost\r\n  - **Place:** here, there, everywhere\r\n- **Usage in a Sentence:**\r\n  - \"She runs *quickly*.\" (modifies the verb \"runs\" to describe how she runs)\r\n  - \"He is *extremely* happy.\" (modifies the adjective \"happy\" to intensify the description)\r\n  - \"They arrived *late*.\" (modifies the verb \"arrived\" to indicate the time of arrival)\r\n\r\n**Key Differences**\r\n- **Function:**  \r\n  - **Verbs:** Describe what the subject is doing or experiencing.\r\n  - **Adverbs:** Describe how, when, where, or to what extent something happens.\r\n- **Modification:**  \r\n  - **Verbs:** Can be the main word that conveys an action or state.  \r\n  - **Adverbs:** Typically modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs rather than functioning as the main action in a sentence.\r\n\r\n**Examples Demonstrating Both**\r\n1. \"The dog *barked* loudly.\"  \r\n   - Verb: \"barked\" (action of making a sound)  \r\n   - Adverb: \"loudly\" (describes the manner in which the dog barked)\r\n\r\n2. \"She *carefully* placed the vase on the table.\"  \r\n   - Verb: \"placed\" (action)  \r\n   - Adverb: \"carefully\" (describes the manner observed)\r\n\r\nIn summary, verbs tell what is happening or be, while adverbs provide more details about how, when, or to what degree that action or state occurs.\r\n\r\n**Adjectives** \r\n\r\nAdjectives are words that describe, modify, or give more information about nouns (or pronouns) in a sentence. They help specify qualities or characteristics, such as size, color, shape, and more. Here’s a comprehensive overview:\r\n\r\n**Definition**\r\n- **Adjectives:** Words that modify nouns or pronouns by providing descriptors or qualifiers. They answer questions like \"What kind?\", \"Which one?\", and \"How many?\"\r\n\r\n**Functions of Adjectives**\r\n- **Descriptive:** Provide specific details about a noun.\r\n  - Example: \"The *red* apple is on the table.\"\r\n- **Quantitative:** Indicate quantity.\r\n  - Example: \"She has *three* dogs.\"\r\n- **Demonstrative:** Point to specific entities.\r\n  - Example: \"*This* book is interesting.\"\r\n- **Possessive:** Denote ownership.\r\n  - Example: \"*My* car is fast.\"\r\n- **Interrogative:** Used in questions.\r\n  - Example: \"*Which* movie do you want to watch?\"\r\n- **Comparative and Superlative:** Compare qualities of nouns.\r\n  - Example: \"He is *taller* than his brother.\" (Comparative) / \"She is the *tallest* in the class.\" (Superlative)\r\n\r\n**Placement in a Sentence**\r\n- **Before the Noun:**  \r\n  - \"The *beautiful* garden blossomed in the spring.\"\r\n- **After Linking Verbs:**  \r\n  - \"The cat is *black*.\" (Here, the adjective describes the subject via the linking verb \"is.\")\r\n\r\n**Examples in Sentences**\r\n1. \"The *old, dusty* book sat on the shelf.\"  \r\n   - Adjectives: \"old\" and \"dusty\" modify the noun \"book.\"\r\n2. \"They adopted a *small* puppy.\"  \r\n   - Adjective: \"small\" describes the noun \"puppy.\"\r\n3. \"I read an *interesting* article.\"  \r\n   - Adjective: \"interesting\" describes the noun \"article.\"\r\n\r\n**Differences from Other Parts of Speech**\r\n- **Verbs:** Express actions, occurrences, or states of being.\r\n- **Adverbs:** Modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs.\r\n- **Adjectives:** Specifically modify nouns and pronouns.\r\n\r\nIn summary, adjectives enrich our language by adding detail and nuance to our descriptions of people, places, things, and ideas.",

Not all guitarists can read music, but [chord layouts](https://t.ly/OQyYx) are the easiest visual image fora guitarist in learning how to play a composition. Not all guitarists can read music, but guitarists will find chord diagrams easy to follow.\r\n\r\nChord diagrams make it easy for a guitarist to learn to play chords of a song or an instrumental - if they are adept at playing each chord in the first instance. When chords are included in a music layout for the guitar, a guitarist can learn to play the composition gradually, through breaking the composition down into sequential segments.\r\n\r\nComplementing a music score, chord layouts will be vitally important to a guitarist who can read music. This will allow a guitarist to play both rhythm guitar and lead guitar parts by sight alone. Without a chord diagram, a guitarist who can't read music will either need to play the parts by ear, or be taught by a fellow guitarist the chords and notes of the composition. For a skilled guitarist, who only uses chord diagrams, they will be able to work out the notes of a composition via the chords.\r\n\r\n• A Vital Aid in Learning How to Play\r\n\r\nFor beginner guitarists, chord position layouts are essential in helping a guitarist learn how to play. Even for someone who can read music, learning the chords is the first part of learning how to play the guitar. Chord layouts are particularly useful for a music teacher in teaching budding guitarists the basics of learning how to play the guitar. Once a guitarist has managed to master the basic chords, such as\r\n\r\n`G, G7, D7, C, F, F7, A, E, Em, D`\r\n\r\netc, then they can progress to playing compositions, and then notes. Chord diagrams make it easy for a beginner to practice on their own also.\r\n\r\nWhen guitarists want to play the same song together, [chord diagrams](http://www.guitar-chords.org.uk) simplifies and speeds up the process. When the chords have been learnt then each guitarist has the foundations of the song. This allows each guitarist to improvise around the chords much more easily.\r\n\r\n• Easy for Guitarists to Follow\r\n\r\nFor guitarists who are songwriters, and who can't read music, the best way of writing down their composition is through chord diagrams. It's also the best way of helping other guitarists, who can't read music, to learn a composition. The chord diagram of a song is easy to create and pass around.\r\n\r\nAnyone thinking of learning how to play the guitar will become more encouraged to do so when they are able to find a way of learning to play that isn't complicated. The beauty of chord diagrams is that they do this.\r\n\r\nLinks: \r\n[Guitarmetrics](https://guitarmetrics.com/blogs/mastering-your-guitar-skills)  \r\n[Master the fretboard](https://t.ly/uW_im)\r\n",

      "content": "How to Locate Hard Drive UUIDs in Linux ✓\r\n\r\nTo find the UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) of hard drives in Linux, you can use several methods. Here are some common approaches:\r\n\r\n### 1. Using the `blkid` Command\r\nThe `blkid` command is a simple way to list all block devices and their UUIDs.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsudo blkid\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis command will display output similar to the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/dev/sda1: UUID=\"1234-5678\" TYPE=\"ext4\" \r\n/dev/sdb1: UUID=\"8765-4321\" TYPE=\"xfs\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 2. Using the `lsblk` Command\r\nThe `lsblk` command can also show UUIDs along with other information about block devices.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nlsblk -o NAME,UUID\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will provide a list of devices with their names and UUIDs.\r\n\r\n### 3. Checking `/dev/disk/by-uuid/`\r\nYou can also look in the `/dev/disk/by-uuid/` directory, which contains symbolic links to devices based on their UUIDs.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid/\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will show you the UUIDs and the corresponding device names.\r\n\r\n### 4. Using the `fdisk` Command\r\nWhile `fdisk` is primarily used for partitioning, it can also show UUIDs.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsudo fdisk -l\r\n```\r\n\r\nLook for the UUIDs in the output, although this method may not always display them.\r\n\r\n### 5. Using `parted`\r\nThe `parted` command can also be used to list UUIDs.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsudo parted -l\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will show detailed information about all partitions, including their UUIDs.\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\nAny of these methods will help you find the UUIDs of your hard drives in Linux. The `blkid` command is often the most straightforward and commonly used method.",

Now we have created a git repository. Lets push it to github. To do this, create a private git repository in github.\r\n\r\nNow, we will link our local repository to github(remote) repository\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit remote add origin git@github.com:<your-username>/<repo-name>.gitgit push --set-upstream origin master\r\n```\r\n\r\nDone. So now we have a repository on hand to save our notes. Now we can add/edit notes. Commit the changes and push them to remote. Now, lets automate it ;)\r\n\r\n```\r\n#!/bin/bashcd $(dirname `which $0`)git pullgit add .git commit -m \"Notes - $(date)\"git pushecho \"Done\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nCopy this code and save in a file named ‘git-sync.sh’ in your project root directory (~/Notes in this example) and make it executable `chmod +x ~/Notes/git-sync.sh`\r\n\r\nNow create a new notes file and save it. Then simply run `sh git-sync.sh` . You can see your note in github immediately.\r\n\r\nNow, lets become more lazy..\r\n\r\nWe are working on code editor, we may save notes right from the editor, and we cannot run `sh git-sync.sh` every time. So it should run every time when we save a file. We will automate this as well.\r\n\r\nI’ll show you an example with VS Code — My favourite editor (You continue to read this, and then you can google to find how to do it in your favourite editor)\r\n\r\nThis [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dionmunk.vscode-notes) is what I use to write notes right from VS Code. You can configure your notes directory to your repository. To do this, add following snippet in your VS code `settings.json`\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"Notes.notesLocation\": \"/<your-home>/Notes\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow you can see your notes added in Notes repository are visible in editor itself. Now we can edit your notes right from VS Code.\r\n\r\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*QkafNu6DTqJb8ym_nllI0g.png)\r\n\r\nSeeing our first note in VS code\r\n\r\nBut it is not in sync with github. To sync, we should trigger `git-sync.sh` right. Well.\r\n\r\nThere is another [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pucelle.run-on-save) in VS Code which allows you to do something when a file is saved. Install this extension and then open \\`settings.json\\`\r\n\r\n```\r\n{   \"runOnSave.commands\": [      {         \"match\": \"/<your-home>/Notes/.*\",         \"notMatch\": \"\",         \"command\": \"/<your-home>/Notes/git-sync.sh\",         \"runIn\": \"backend\",         \"runningStatusMessage\": \"Syncing Notes...\",         \"finishStatusMessage\": \"Notes Sync Successful\"      }   ],   \"runOnSave.statusMessageTimeout\": 5000}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdd the following settings to your settings.json file.\r\n\r\nNow try to edit something and save the notes. You can see `Syncing Notes...` message in status bar.\r\n\r\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:709/1*mqlKebkSfRerF04VkQopCA.png)\r\n\r\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:738/1*q_zQyhF3GjNaoBrC0Q8_AQ.png)\r\n\r\nSyncing notes to github repository\r\n\r\nWell done. Go to your github repository and see your notes is updated there as well. Cool\r\n\r\nThis is the easiest way I find to write notes right from the code editor and getting it saved in remote at no cost.\r\n",

      "content": "✏️  Rclone Sync & Backup Files\r\n(edit tags, maybe sumat else)\r\n\r\nTo sync and back up files using Rclone, you can use its powerful cmd-line interface to perform various operations. Since you already have Rclone set up and mounted to a cloud storage drive, here’s a step-by-step guide on how to sync and back up your files:\r\n\r\n**Step 1: Verify Your Rclone Config**\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding, ensure that your Rclone configuration is set up correctly. You can check your remote configurations by running:\r\n\r\n`rclone listremotes`\r\n\r\nThis command will display a list of configured remotes (e.g., your cloud storage).\r\n\r\n**Step 2: Syncing Files**\r\n\r\nTo sync files from your local directory to your cloud storage, you can use the `rclone sync` command. The basic syntax is:\r\n\r\n`rclone sync /path/to/local/directory remote:remote_directory`\r\n\r\n- Replace `/path/to/local/directory` with the path to the local folder you want to back up.\r\n- Replace `remote:remote_directory` with your configured remote name and the target directory in your cloud storage.\r\n\r\n**Example:**\r\n\r\n`rclone sync /home/user/myfolder remote:mybackupfolder`\r\n\r\nThis command will sync the contents of `myfolder` to `mybackupfolder` in your cloud storage. Note that `sync` will make the destination identical to the source, meaning it will delete files in the destination that are not present in the source.\r\n\r\n**Step 3: Backing Up Files**\r\n\r\nIf you want to back up files without deleting anything in the destination, you can use the `rclone copy` command instead. The syntax is similar:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nrclone copy /path/to/local/directory remote:remote_directory\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Example:**\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nrclone copy /home/user/myfolder remote:mybackupfolder\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis command will copy the contents of `myfolder` to `mybackupfolder` without deleting any existing files in the destination.\r\n\r\n**Step 4: Additional Options**\r\n\r\nRclone provides various options to customize your sync or copy operations. Here are a few useful flags:\r\n\r\n- `--dry-run`   Simulates the operation without making any changes. This is useful for testing what will happen.\r\n  \r\n  ```bash\r\n  rclone sync /home/user/myfolder remote:mybackupfolder --dry-run\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- `--progress`  Displays progress during the transfer.\r\n\r\n  ```bash\r\n  rclone sync /home/user/myfolder remote:mybackupfolder --progress\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- `--exclude`  Excludes specific files or directories from the sync.\r\n\r\n  ```bash\r\n  rclone sync /home/user/myfolder remote:mybackupfolder --exclude \"*.tmp\"\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- `--delete-excluded`  Deletes files in the destination that are excluded from the source.\r\n\r\n**Step 5: Scheduling Backups**\r\n\r\nTo automate your backup process, you can create a cron job (on Linux) to run your Rclone commands at specified intervals. For example, to run a backup every day at 2 AM, you can add the following line to your crontab:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n0 2 * * * rclone sync /home/user/myfolder remote:mybackupfolder\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Conclusion**\r\n\r\nUsing Rclone for syncing and backing up files is straightforward and powerful. By utilizing the `sync` and `copy` commands, along with various options, you can effectively manage your backups to cloud storage. Always remember to test your commands with the `--dry-run` option before executing them to avoid unintended data loss.\r\n\r\n**Use YAD (Yet Another Dialog) to create a GUI progress dialog** \r\n\r\nYAD is a tool that allows you to create GTK+ dialogs from the command line, and it can be particularly useful for displaying progress for long-running tasks like file synchronization or backup operations.\r\n\r\n### Example of Using YAD with Rclone\r\n\r\nHere’s a basic example of how to use YAD to show progress while running an Rclone sync or copy command.\r\n\r\n1. **Install YAD**: If you haven't installed YAD yet, you can do so using your package manager.\r\n\r\n2. **Bash Script for Rclone Sync with YAD**: use this bash script that runs the Rclone command and uses YAD to display the progress. Here’s a simple example script:\r\n\r\n   ```bash\r\n   #!/bin/bash\r\n\r\n   # Define your source and destination\r\n   SOURCE=\"/path/to/local/directory\"\r\n   DESTINATION=\"remote:remote_directory\"\r\n\r\n   # Run Rclone with YAD progress dialog\r\n   rclone sync \"$SOURCE\" \"$DESTINATION\" --progress | yad --progress --title=\"Rclone Sync\" --text=\"Syncing files...\" --percentage=0 --auto-close --no-cancel --width=300 --height=100 --timeout=10 --timeout-indicator=top\r\n\r\n   # Check the exit status of Rclone\r\n   if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then\r\n       yad --title=\"Success\" --text=\"Sync completed successfully!\" --button=\"OK\"\r\n   else\r\n       yad --title=\"Error\" --text=\"An error occurred during sync.\" --button=\"OK\"\r\n   fi\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n3. **Make the Script Executable**: Save the script to a file, for example, `rclone_sync.sh`, and make it executable:\r\n\r\n   ```bash\r\n   chmod +x rclone_sync.sh\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n4. **Run the Script**: Execute the script to start the sync process with a YAD progress dialog:\r\n\r\n   ```bash\r\n   ./rclone_sync.sh\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n### Important Notes\r\n\r\n- **Progress Output**: The `--progress` flag in the Rclone command outputs progress information to the terminal. YAD can read this output to update the progress bar. However, you may need to parse the output to extract the percentage and update the YAD dialog accordingly.\r\n\r\n- **Advanced Usage**: For more advanced usage, you can customize the YAD dialog further, such as adding buttons, changing colors, or modifying the layout.\r\n\r\n- **Error Handling**: The script includes basic error handling to notify you if the sync operation was successful or if an error occurred.\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n\r\nUsing YAD with Rclone can enhance the user experience by providing a graphical interface to monitor the progress of file synchronization or backup operations. You can customize the script to fit your specific needs and improve the functionality as required.\r\n\r\nTo make the Rclone sync script compatible with the Fish shell, you'll need to adjust the syntax since Fish has a different syntax compared to Bash. Below is a modified version of the script that works with Fish shell:\r\n\r\n### Fish Shell Script for Rclone Sync with YAD\r\n\r\n```fish\r\n#!/usr/bin/env fish\r\n\r\n# Define your source and destination\r\nset SOURCE \"/path/to/local/directory\"\r\nset DESTINATION \"remote:remote_directory\"\r\n\r\n# Run Rclone with YAD progress dialog\r\nrclone sync $SOURCE $DESTINATION --progress | yad --progress --title=\"Rclone Sync\" --text=\"Syncing files...\" --percentage=0 --auto-close --no-cancel --width=300 --height=100 --timeout=10 --timeout-indicator=top\r\n\r\n# Check the exit status of Rclone\r\nif test $status -eq 0\r\n    yad --title=\"Success\" --text=\"Sync completed successfully!\" --button=\"OK\"\r\nelse\r\n    yad --title=\"Error\" --text=\"An error occurred during sync.\" --button=\"OK\"\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Steps to Use the Script\r\n\r\n1. **Create the Script**: Save the above code to a file, for example, `rclone_sync.fish`.\r\n\r\n2. **Make the Script Executable**: Run the following command to make the script executable:\r\n\r\n   ```fish\r\n   chmod +x rclone_sync.fish\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n3. **Run the Script**: Execute the script in your Fish shell:\r\n\r\n   ```fish\r\n   ./rclone_sync.fish\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n### Important Notes\r\n\r\n- **YAD Progress Output**: The `--progress` flag in the Rclone command outputs progress information to the terminal. The YAD dialog will show a progress bar, but you may need to implement additional parsing of the Rclone output to update the progress bar accurately. The current script does not parse the output for percentage updates; it simply shows a dialog.\r\n\r\n- **Error Handling**: The script includes basic error handling to notify you if the sync operation was successful or if an error occurred.\r\n\r\n- **Adjust Paths**: Make sure to replace `/path/to/local/directory` and `remote:remote_directory` with your actual source and destination paths.\r\n\r\nThis Fish shell script should work similarly to the Bash version, providing a graphical progress dialog while syncing files with Rclone.",

They are used in shell scripting and command-line interfaces to perform various operations. Here are some common types of operators in the context of Linux:\r\n\r\n1. **Arithmetic Operators**: Used for mathematical calculations in shell scripts.\r\n   - `+` (addition)\r\n   - `-` (subtraction)\r\n   - `*` (multiplication)\r\n   - `/` (division)\r\n   - `%` (modulus)  \r\n\r\n2. **Comparison Operators**: Used to compare values, often within conditional statements.\r\n   - `-eq` (equal to)\r\n   - `-ne` (not equal to)\r\n   - `-gt` (greater than)\r\n   - `-lt` (less than)\r\n   - `-ge` (greater than or equal to)\r\n   - `-le` (less than or equal to)\r\n\r\n3. **Logical Operators**: Used to combine conditions.\r\n   - `&&` (logical AND)\r\n   - `||` (logical OR)\r\n   - `!` (logical NOT)\r\n\r\n4. **Redirection Operators**: Used to redirect input and output.\r\n   - `>` (redirect output to a file)\r\n   - `>>` (append output to a file)\r\n   - `<` (redirect input from a file)\r\n   - `2>` (redirect error output to a file)\r\n   - `&>` (redirect both standard output and error)\r\n\r\n5. **Pipe Operator**: Used to pass the output of one command as input to another.\r\n   - `|` (pipe)\r\n\r\n6. **Background Operator**: Used to run a command in the background.\r\n   - `&` (run command in the background)\r\n\r\n7. **Command Substitution**: Used to execute a command and substitute its output.\r\n   - `` `command` `` or `$(command)`\r\n\r\nThese operators are essential for writing scripts and executing commands efficiently in the Linux shell environment.\r\n\r\nMore here [Arithmetic Operators](simplenote://note/5aacd960-fed3-40b9-9090-cebacdaf4eeb)\r\n\r\n---",

Benny Hill, seven years younger than Howerd, was quoted in the press as being ‘very upset’ and saying, ‘We were great, great friends.’ Indeed they had been friends, but Hill hadn’t given a quote about his fellow comedian, he hadn’t even been asked for one – he couldn’t have been – because he was already dead. The quote about Howerd had actually come from Hill’s friend, former producer and unofficial press agent Dennis Kirkland, who hadn’t been able to get in contact with Hill and was starting to worry.\r\n\r\nIt wasn’t until the 20th, the day after Howerd had died, that a neighbour noticed an unpleasant smell coming from Flat 7 of Fairwater House on the Twickenham Road in Teddington. The neighbour contacted Kirkland, who was a regular visitor to the Teddington apartment block, and it wasn’t long before the television producer was climbing a ladder and peering through the window of Hill’s second-floor flat. Inside he saw his friend surrounded by dirty plates, glasses, videotapes and piles of papers, slumped on the sofa in front of the TV. The body was blue, bloated and distended and there was a dried trickle of blood that had seeped from one of his ears. Hill had been dead for two days. He had only been seen in public a few days before when he had sat in the audience of *Me & My Girl* at London’s Adelphi Theatre. Benny had gone along to see Louise English, an ex-Hill’s Angel who was appearing with Les Dennis. On the same evening, having recovered from heart trouble himself just a few months earlier, Benny had sent Frankie a telegram: ‘Stop stealing my act – I do the heart attack jokes.’\r\n\r\n[![Benny Hill](https://flashbak.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/1.-Benny-Hill-in-his-kichen-at-his-flat-at-1-2-Queensgate-in-May-1969.jpg)](https://flashbak.com/the-rise-fall-and-lonely-death-of-benny-hill-371668/comedian-benny-hill-in-his-flat-in-the-kitchen-1969-january-21st-marks-the-anniversary-of-the-birth-of-british-comedian-alfred-h/)\r\n\r\nBenny Hill in his flat on Queensgate, London, January 1969\r\n\r\n[![Frankie Howerd with Normal Wisdom (far left) in 'Fine Goings On', BBC series in 1951.](https://flashbak.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Frankie-Howerd-with-Normal-Wisdom-far-left-in-Fine-Goings-On-BBC-Light-Programme-series-1951.jpg)](https://flashbak.com/the-rise-fall-and-lonely-death-of-benny-hill-371668/frankie-howerd-with-normal-wisdom-far-left-in-fine-goings-on-bbc-light-programme-series-1951/)\r\n\r\nFrankie Howerd, who died the day after his friend Benny Hill, with Norman Wisdom (far left) in ‘Fine Goings On’, BBC series in 1951.\r\n\r\n[![Benny Hill ](https://flashbak.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Benny-Hill-14.jpeg)](https://flashbak.com/the-rise-fall-and-lonely-death-of-benny-hill-371668/benny-hill-14/)\r\n\r\nBenny Hill leaving hospital after heart trouble a few months before he died in 1992.\r\n\r\n[![Benny Hill at his house in Twickenham in 1991.

Photo by [Rob Baker](http://www.nickelinthemachine.com/)\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1940 and during the height of the Blitz, Alfred Hawthorne Hill or, as he was usually known, Alfie arrived at Waterloo on a Southampton train. He was just seventeen. He’d given up his Eastleigh milk round, which really did have a horse and a cart, and he had sold his drum kit for £6 to finance the next part of his life. There was almost nothing in this Max Miller fan’s head but an ambition to succeed as a comic performer – show business was in the family’s blood; both his father and his grandfather had once been circus clowns. He had with him the addresses of three variety theatres in his pocket, but after a week of sleeping rough in a Streatham bomb shelter, it was luck rather than judgement that enabled the naive Hampshire boy to get a dogsbody job from a kindly agent. Hill remembered this time in 1955: ‘At the Chiswick Empire they did not want to know about Alf Hill. I had much the same reception at the “Met”, but at the Chelsea Palace I was lucky enough to arrange to see Harry Benet at his of office the next morning.’ Hill turned up at Benet’s Beak Street office and was offered £3 per week to be an assistant stage manager (with small parts) for a new revue called *Follow the Fan*. For years after Hill would often joke that although he was no longer an ASM, he still had small parts.\r\n\r\n[![Three pictures of Benny Hill early in his career.](https://flashbak.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Benny-Hill-three-early-pictures-1280x701.jpg)](https://flashbak.com/the-rise-fall-and-lonely-death-of-benny-hill-371668/benny-hill-three-early-pictures/)\r\n\r\nThree pictures of Benny Hill early in his career.\r\n\r\nTwelve months or so later Hill, now eighteen, had become eligible for conscription but by now he was having the time of his life. He thought naively that by travelling around the country (he was now with *Send Them Victorious*, another revue) he could pretend he had never received the OHMS manila envelope ordering him to enlist. The ruse worked until November 1942, when the show was at the New Theatre in Cardiff for the last engagement before the pantomime season. Two military policemen presented themselves at the theatre stage door and Alfie Hill was ‘advised’ to give himself up. He couldn’t drive and he knew nothing about engines, but within a month Hill found himself a private in the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers as a driver and mechanic. Not surprisingly, considering his lack of knowledge or interest in engines, Alfie Hill played no real useful part in the war. Although he was taught to drive in the army he would subsequently never own a car or drive in his civilian life.\r\n\r\n[![Benny Hill in the army c.1944.](https://flashbak.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Benny-Hill-23-copy.jpg)](https://flashbak.com/the-rise-fall-and-lonely-death-of-benny-hill-371668/benny-hill-23-copy/)\r\n\r\nBenny Hill in the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers c.1944.\r\n\r\nNot long after VE Day, and when he was in London on leave, Hill applied to be part of the services’ touring revue called *Stars in Battledress*. There was one problem: he didn’t have ‘an act’, and he had just twenty-four hours to create one. For inspiration he walked to the Windmill Theatre on Great Windmill Street in Soho – he knew that it was the one place in London where you could see comedians during the day. He noticed one Windmill turn in particular, a man called Peter Waring whose scripts were written by Frank Muir, who at that time was still attached to the RAF. Hill would later say: ‘Waring was the biggest influence on my life. He was delicate, highly strung and sensitive…when I saw him I thought, “My God, it’s so easy. You don’t have to come on shouting, ‘Ere, ’ere, missus! Got the music ’Arry? Now missus, don’t get your knickers in a twist!’ You can come on like Waring and say, ‘Not many in tonight. There’s enough room at the back to play rugby. My God, they are playing rugby…’\r\n\r\n[![The Windmill Theatre in 1945.](https://flashbak.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Windmill-Theatre.jpeg)](https://flashbak.com/the-rise-fall-and-lonely-death-of-benny-hill-371668/windmill-theatre-2/)\r\n\r\nThe Windmill Theatre in 1945.\r\n\r\n### The Windmill Theatre\r\n\r\nThe Windmill Theatre on the corner of Great Windmill Street and Archer Street, just off Shaftesbury Avenue, was a magnet to many of the new wave ex-servicemen comedians, of whom there were many. The theatre was infamous for its risqué dancing girls and nude tableaux, but the shows also featured a small resident ballet company, a singer or two and some brand-new comedians usually at the start of their career. It was a tough crowd for the comedians – not too many patrons were there for the jokes.\r\n\r\nThe theatre had been bought in 1930 by a seventy-year-old ‘white- haired, bright-eyed little woman in mink’ called Mrs Laura Henderson whose late husband ‘had been something in Jute’. At the time it was a run-down old cinema called the Palais de Luxe (actually one of the  first in London) but she had the building extensively rebuilt, glamorously faced with glazed white terracotta and renamed the Windmill Theatre. Under the careful guidance of her manager Vivian Van Damme, a small neat man who more often than not would be smoking a cigar, the theatre slowly became a success. The ‘Mill’, as it became known in its heyday, started to present a non-stop type of revue that had a terrible title which assimilated the word ‘nude’ and ‘revue’ and was called Revudeville.\r\n\r\nVan Damme, amusingly known as VD to everyone backstage, had an astute judgement of both English sexual taste and of what the Lord Chamberlain – the national theatre censor – would allow. ‘It’s all right to be nude, but if it moves, it’s rude,’ said Rowland Thomas Baring, 2nd Earl of Cromer, who was the Lord Chamberlain at the time. On the Sunday night before any new show opened Van Damme would invite the Earl of Cromer to a special performance. To make the censor’s mood amenable to what he was about to see, VD made sure there was generous hospitality before the curtain was raised. It was said that the Lord Chamberlain never delegated his responsibilities on these occasions.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the war the government ordered compulsory closure of all the theatres in the West End – a stricture that, due to many protests, ended less than two weeks later. The Windmill re-opened immediately and stayed open throughout the rest of the war with five or six performances a day. The shows started at 11 a.m. and continued until 10.35 p.m. at night. During the worst of the Blitz it was sometimes too dangerous to expect people to get home safely and the stagehands and performers often slept in the lower two floors underground. Around 1943 the theatre created its famous motto – ‘We never closed’ – although wags quickly changed this to ‘We never clothed’. In fact the ‘Mill’ became a semi-cherished institution and garnered a reputation of defiance. This, together with Van Damme’s tasteful ‘girl-next-door’ version of English femininity, made the Windmill Theatre a major symbol for London’s ‘Blitz Spirit’ all around the world. This was summed up at the theatre one evening when one naked young woman broke the ‘no moving’ rule by brazenly raising her hand to give a V-sign at a V1 bomb that had exploded nearby. She earned herself a standing ovation.\r\n\r\nOnce the audience arrived in the morning some of them would stay and watch all the six shows throughout the evening and night. Des O’Connor, just one of the comedians who got an early break at the Windmill, was on his fifth show of the day when he completely dried up. Somebody, who had been at all the previous shows that day, shouted out: ‘You do the one about the parrot next!’ During the later performances the audience that were sitting in the back of the stalls would wait for those in the front rows to get up and leave. When they did, the men at the back would quickly leap over the seats to get to the front – a daily event that became known as the ‘Windmill Steeplechase’.\r\n\r\n[![Vivian van Damm](https://flashbak.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Vivian-Van-Damm-2.jpg)](https://flashbak.com/the-rise-fall-and-lonely-death-of-benny-hill-371668/vivian-van-damm-2/)\r\n\r\nVivian van Damm\r\n\r\n[![Windmill Girls during WW2](https://flashbak.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Windmill-Girls-during-the-war.jpg)](https://flashbak.com/the-rise-fall-and-lonely-death-of-benny-hill-371668/windmill-girls-during-the-war/)\r\n\r\nWindmill Girls during WW2\r\n\r\n[![Doreen Lord and Beryl Catlin up on the roof of the Windmill c.1950](https://flashbak.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/14.-Doreen-Lord-and-Beryl-Catlin-up-on-the-roof-of-the-Windmill-c.1950-1280x1005.jpg)](https://flashbak.com/the-rise-fall-and-lonely-death-of-benny-hill-371668/14-doreen-lord-and-beryl-catlin-up-on-the-roof-of-the-windmill-c-1950/)\r\n\r\nDoreen Lord and Beryl Catlin up on the roof of the Windmill c.1950\r\n\r\nBenny Hill, who by now had changed his name – he thought Alfie Hill made him sound like a cheap barrow boy and Jack Benny was one of his favourite comedians – had two auditions at the Windmill. On both occasions, and after barely finishing his  first gag, he got a dreaded ‘Thank you, next please’ from Van Damm somewhere in the darkness of the stalls. He certainly wasn’t the only comedian who would later go on to become a huge star but was rejected by the Windmill Theatre. Both Bob Monkhouse and Norman Wisdom also failed to get past the one- man Van Damm judging panel. The list of comics who did perform at the Windmill is extraordinary, however, and included Jimmy Edwards, Tony Hancock, Arthur English, Harry Secombe, Peter Sellers, Michael Bentine, Bruce Forsyth, Dave Allen, Alfred Marks, Max Bygraves, Tommy Cooper and Barry Cryer. There was a comedy revolution taking place and performers who, in a sense, had wasted years of their young adulthood on the war, were desperate to make up for lost time. They had seen the best of humanity and, of course, the worst. They had a connection with each other like no generation since.\r\n\r\nFor Hill, after failing his second audition at the Windmill, it was back to the working men’s clubs in parts of London like Streatham, Tottenham and Harlesden. In those days the Soho agents never actually mentioned money and used to show the amount that was to be paid by laying fingers on the lapels of their jackets. One finger meant £1 while two fingers meant double. It was nearly always the former for Benny back then. As the months went by his act was getting more and more polished and in 1948, in a rehearsal room across the road from the Windmill, he had an audition as Reg Varney’s straight-man in a revue called *Gaytime*. There were only two people auditioning for the part and Hill had performed an English calypso (this would have been pretty rare just after the war), which he sang to his own guitar accompaniment:\r\n\r\n> *We have two Bev’ns in our Cabinet/Aneurin’s the one with the gift of the gab in it/The other Bev’n’s the taciturnist/He knows the importance of being Ernest!*\r\n\r\nAfter he had performed his musical comedy turn, Hill was told by Hedley Claxton, an impresario who specialised in seaside shows, that he had got the job. The other contender for the role that afternoon in 1948 was a young impressionist from Camden called Peter Sellers. Later that year Peter Sellers secured a six-month booking at the Windmill performing in sketches or sometimes as an impersonator. It wasn’t his first appearance at the Windmill. As a child he had performed in a show with his mother Peg, who was a burlesque dancer at the theatre not long after it opened. Hill and Reg Varney’s double act was generally a success, and they were signed up for three seasons of *Gaytime* and subsequently a touring version of a London Palladium revue called *Sky High*. The weakest spots in the shows were Hill’s solo performances – he found it difficult to engage with the audiences, especially in the north of England. When the revue opened at the Sunderland Empire the local newspaper wrote: ‘I thought Reg Varney’s personality pleasing and warming, but was not so “taken” with some of his comedy.’ Presumably out of kindness there was no mention of his comic partner. Hill had completely died in his own solo spot and it had ended after the audience started giving him a slow handclap.\r\n\r\n[![Reg Varney and Benny Hill in Gaytime.](https://flashbak.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Reg-Varney-and-Benny-Hill.jpeg)](https://flashbak.com/the-rise-fall-and-lonely-death-of-benny-hill-371668/reg-varney-and-benny-hill/)\r\n\r\nReg Varney and Benny Hill in Gaytime.\r\n\r\nBy this time Hill had already appeared on BBC radio a few times but struggled to make his mark. A particularly damning BBC report on Benny Hill, dated 10 October 1947, said:\r\n\r\n> Ronald Waldman: The only trouble with him was that he didn’t make me laugh at all – and for a comedian that’s not very good. It’s a mixture of lack of comedy personality and lack of comedy material. Harry Pepper: I find him without personality and very dully unfunny.\r\n\r\nIn 1950, at a time when only one in twenty households owned a television, Hill, unlike many performers and agents who either feared it or thought it a flash in the pan, realised that television would be huge and all-consuming. He understood that it would gobble up comic material and that it was already ending the career of variety artists who had successfully performed the same act all their lives. Comic writers started to be as important as the performers, perhaps even more so, and Hill started to write literally hundreds and hundreds of sketches, eventually submitting great numbers of them to the BBC. The head of Light Entertainment was now Ronald Waldman, who three years previously had criticised Hill’s lack of comedy material and the ability to make him laugh at all. This time, however, Waldman was more than impressed and offered Benny Hill his own show right there and then.\r\n\r\n[![Benny Hill ](https://flashbak.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Benny-Hill-poster-Fine-Fettle-copy.jpg)](https://flashbak.com/the-rise-fall-and-lonely-death-of-benny-hill-371668/benny-hill-poster-fine-fettle-copy/)\r\n\r\nBenny Hill in ‘Fine Fettle’ at the Palace Theatre in 1956. Hill was never comfortable performing live.\r\n\r\n*Hi There* was transmitted on the BBC on the evening of 20 August 1951 and the 45-minute one-off show, featuring a series of sketches wholly written by Benny Hill, was relatively well-received. It wasn’t until four years later, however, that Hill got his own BBC series when in January 1955 the first ever *The Benny Hill Show* was broadcast. Hill was always a relatively uncomfortable performer on stage. Roy Hudd once wrote: ‘I saw him several times live and he never seemed totally at home with an audience.’ Dennis Kirkland later wrote that ‘He made no secret of his hatred for live theatre. It made him sweat; literally shake with nerves.’ The new medium of television utterly suited Hill with his ‘conspiratorial glances and anticipatory smirks’ to camera. After a shaky first episode the rest of the series was a big success and in some ways set a new standard for British television comedy. Hill used all the expertise of the studio make-up department to great effect, and also utilised new technology enabling him to include recorded inserts in his sketches and use split screen trickery, for instance, to play all the panellists in parodies of programmes such as *What’s My Line?* and *Juke Box Jury*.\r\n\r\n[![The BBC's 'The Benny Hill Show' from 1955.](https://flashbak.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/PA-7125497-Benny-Hill-BBC-1955-980x1024.jpg)](https://flashbak.com/the-rise-fall-and-lonely-death-of-benny-hill-371668/television-programmes-bbc-tv-the-benny-hill-show/)\r\n\r\nThe BBC’s ‘The Benny Hill Show’ from 1955.\r\n\r\n[![TV Comedian Benny Hill auditioning chorus girls for his new show, 1955.](https://flashbak.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/PA-1194269-Benny-Hill-and-legs-1955-1280x968.jpg)](https://flashbak.com/the-rise-fall-and-lonely-death-of-benny-hill-371668/benny-hillaudition/)\r\n\r\nTV Comedian Benny Hill auditioning chorus girls for his new show, 1955.\r\n\r\n[!['The Benny Hill Show' - ](https://flashbak.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Benny-Hill-making-face-copy-1280x1015.jpg)](https://flashbak.com/the-rise-fall-and-lonely-death-of-benny-hill-371668/itv-archive-10/)\r\n\r\n‘The Benny Hill Show’\r\n\r\n[![Benny Hill in 1957](https://flashbak.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Benny-Hill-in-1957-1063x1024.jpg)](https://flashbak.com/the-rise-fall-and-lonely-death-of-benny-hill-371668/benny-hill-1957/)\r\n\r\nBenny Hill in 1957\r\n\r\nAll this, to people watching at home, made old routines seem brand new. Benny Hill never looked back and was a mainstay of British television for the next thirty-five years. Initially his shows appeared on the BBC but from 1969, when the new London weekday ITV franchise needed some high-profile signings, on Thames Television. The ‘cherub sent by the devil’, as Michael Caine once described Hill, eventually became a big star all over the world. It seemed at one point, just as many in the UK were starting to find his comedy rather old-fashioned and sexist, that the rest of the world thought Benny Hill WAS British comedy. Towards the end of the eighties Colin Shaw of the Broadcasting Standards Council issued a mandate:\r\n\r\n> ‘Although the half undressed woman has been a staple element in farce and light entertainment shows, the convention is becoming increasingly offensive to a growing number of people and should be used only sparingly … It’s not as funny as it was to have half-naked girls chased across the screen by a dirty old man. Attitudes have changed.’\r\n\r\n[![Benny Hill in the stocks for a 1961 series of the Benny Hill Show.](https://flashbak.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/PA-7125652-Benny-Hill-in-the-stocks-1961-958x1024.jpg)](https://flashbak.com/the-rise-fall-and-lonely-death-of-benny-hill-371668/television-programmes-bbc-tv-benny-hill-show/)\r\n\r\nBenny Hill in the stocks for a 1961 series of the Benny Hill Show.\r\n\r\n[![Comedian Benny Hill slides down a slide with two bikini clad women during filming for his latest series (1983).](https://flashbak.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/PA-7481214-Benny-Hill-on-slide-1983-1280x841.jpg)](https://flashbak.com/the-rise-fall-and-lonely-death-of-benny-hill-371668/television-benny-hill/)\r\n\r\nComedian Benny Hill slides down a slide with two bikini clad women during filming for his latest series (1983).\r\n\r\nBenny Hill was very confused about the accusations of sexism in the latter part of his career. He felt that over the years his comedy hadn’t really changed and he’d been doing almost the same thing for decades. This was true; he literally had been telling the same jokes throughout his career and he was always happy to recycle his own material and others. Society around him had moved on, however, and an elderly man surrounded or chased by scantily-clad women made for uncomfortable viewing. There is no doubt that Benny Hill had an odd relationship with women and it appears that Benny Hill never really had a proper relationship during his lifetime. In 1955, just as his career was taking off at the BBC, he was interviewed by Jane Dexter in the Daily Mirror. He was surrounded by dozens of girls, ‘not all overdressed,’ said Dexter, ‘so why did he find it so dificult to find a girlfriend or wife?’ Benny explained:\r\n\r\n> It’s like working in a chocolate factory. You see so many chocolates you don’t bother to take a closer look. Besides I don’t want a glamour girl. I’d like a girl who works in an office or a factory or a shop. That’s where the pretty ones with common sense hide – and that’s where I’m looking.\r\n\r\nIn fact the closest he got to marriage was a couple of years later, with a dancer from the Windmill Theatre called Doris Deal. He took her for meals in the West End, they held hands, and it was assumed they were seeing each other. When Hill procrastinated a little too long and told her he wasn’t ready for marriage, she promptly left him. There were other close, albeit non-romantic, relationships with women through the years including a young Australian actress called Annette André (she went on to appear in *Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased)*). He even proposed to Annette once although, to be polite, she pretended not to notice.\r\n\r\n[![Benny with c.1957](https://flashbak.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Benny-Hill-27-1268x1024.jpeg)](https://flashbak.com/the-rise-fall-and-lonely-death-of-benny-hill-371668/benny-hill-27/)\r\n\r\nBenny out for dinner with Annette André c.1957\r\n\r\n[![Annette André in the episode of Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased) called VENDETTA FOR A DEAD MAN](https://flashbak.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Annette-Andr%C3%A9.jpg)](https://flashbak.com/the-rise-fall-and-lonely-death-of-benny-hill-371668/episode-24-vendetta-for-a-dead-man/)\r\n\r\nAnnette André in the episode of Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased) called VENDETTA FOR A DEAD MAN\r\n\r\nIt seems that Benny Hill, famous throughout the world by surrounding himself with young women, either was scared of intimate sexual intercourse or, as some un-named sources have implied, he was impotent or gay. Before the war some gay dancers he was working with asked a naive Alfie whether he was ‘queer’. Not understanding the question, he answered, ‘Not really, but I’ve got my funny little ways …’ Mark Lewisohn, in his Benny Hill biography *Funny, Peculiar*, recounts a conversation Bob Monkhouse once had with Benny Hill in a cafe in Shaftesbury Avenue:\r\n\r\n> ‘He wanted his women to be more naive than he was, women who would look up to him. He also said it was fellatio he wanted, or masturbation. “But Bob, I get a thrill when they’re kneeling there, between my knees and they’re looking up at me. And I want them to call me Mr Hill, not Benny. ‘Is that all right for you, Mr Hill?’ That’s lovely, that is, I really like that,” I asked him why and he said, “Well, it’s respectful…”’\r\n\r\n[![Benny Hill and Bob Monkhouse](https://flashbak.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Benny-Hill-and-Bob-Monkhouse.jpeg)](https://flashbak.com/the-rise-fall-and-lonely-death-of-benny-hill-371668/benny-hill-and-bob-monkhouse/)\r\n\r\nBenny Hill and Bob Monkhouse\r\n\r\n[![Benny advertising Black and White whisky in 1971.](https://flashbak.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Benny-Hill-Entertains-ad-801x1024.jpg)](https://flashbak.com/the-rise-fall-and-lonely-death-of-benny-hill-371668/benny-hill-entertains-ad/)\r\n\r\nBenny advertising Black and White whisky in 1971.\r\n\r\nIn 1989, twenty years after Benny Hill made his first series for Thames Television, their new Head of Light Entertainment, John Howard Davies, invited him into the offices for a chat. Howard Davies had played the title role in David Lean’s *Oliver Twist* as a nine-year-old in 1948, but as an adult at the BBC had worked on *Steptoe and Son, Monty Python, Fawlty Towers* (it was his idea to cast Prunella Scales as Sybil) and produced all four series of *The Good Life*. Having just returned from a triumphant Cannes Television Festival, Hill, not surprisingly, assumed that they were meeting to discuss the details of some new *Benny Hill Shows*. The former child-star thanked him for all the series he had made for Thames but then promptly sacked him. Howard Davies would later say, ‘It’s very dangerous to have a show on ITV that doesn’t appeal to women, because they hold the purse strings, in a sense.’\r\n\r\nThe following year, in 1990, *The Benny Hill Show* was broadcast in ninety-seven countries around the world, except, ironically, in Britain. Benny Hill never really recovered from the shock of the meeting with Howard Davies and he was certainly treated badly. It was only three years later that Kirkland found him dead in his apartment, just a stone’s throw from the Thames Television studios in Teddington. The worldwide success of his shows made Hill very rich and he left over £7 million pounds in his will. Unfortunately it hadn’t been updated since 1961 and all the beneficiaries, his mum, dad, brother and sister, had also all died. The money went to nieces and nephews he hardly knew.\r\n\r\n> *When I was a lad and crazy to get into showbiz I used to dream of being a comic in a touring revue. They were extraordinary, wonderful shows. There were jugglers and acrobats and singers and comics, and most important of all were the girl dancers. My shows are probably the nearest thing there is on TV to those old revues.* Benny Hill\r\n\r\n[![Comedian Benny Hill in 1986 with his Hill's Angels: (top, l-r) Selina Caston, Lorraine Doyle, Sue Upton, Natalie Rolls; (bottom, l-r) Zoe Bryant, Liz Jobling.](https://flashbak.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Benny-Hill-surrounded-by-girls-1986-1089x1024.jpg)](https://flashbak.com/the-rise-fall-and-lonely-death-of-benny-hill-371668/comedian-benny-hill-2/)\r\n\r\nComedian Benny Hill in 1986 with his Hill’s Angels: (top, l-r) Selina Caston, Lorraine Doyle, Sue Upton, Natalie Rolls; (bottom, l-r) Zoe Bryant, Liz Jobling.\r\n\r\n[!['The Benny Hill Show' TV Programme. 1969 - 1989.](https://flashbak.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Benny-Hill-Cupid-716x1024.jpg)](https://flashbak.com/the-rise-fall-and-lonely-death-of-benny-hill-371668/the-benny-hill-show-tv-programme-1969-1989/)\r\n\r\nThis post is an except from Rob Baker’s London history book [Beautiful Idiots and Brilliant Lunatics](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Beautiful-Idiots-Brilliant-Lunatics-Twentieth-Century/dp/144565119X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1485016658&sr=8-1&keywords=Beautiful+Idiots+and+Brilliant+Lunatics) buy a signed copy [here](http://paypal.me/beautifulidiots/14.99)",

      "content": "Five Best Views In The Yorkshire Dales\r\n\r\n**1\\. Dentdale from 3 Tarns of Whernside**\r\n\r\n![ViewsDentdale](https://where2walk.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Whernside-to-Dentdale-800x445.jpg)\r\n*View down Dentdale*.  \r\n\r\nWhernside is the highest mountain in Yorkshire. It is regularly climbed from Ribblehead and as part of the Yorkshire \r\n[3 Peaks challenge](https://where2walk.co.uk/home/walking-challenges/yorkshire-3-peaks/). However the best way of climbing Whernside (and finding the views) is not via the traditional route but [from Dent](https://where2walk.co.uk/walk/whernside-from-dent) to the west. Alternatively on the climb from Ribblehead do not take the stile but continue on the bridleway to Dentdale. At the Boot on the Wold turn up hill.\r\n\r\nThe best view comes before you meet the first of the Three Tarns. Turn right on a faint track leading to a tall cairn. The views down Dentdale are superb. The U shaped dale is wonderfully symmetrical surrounded by impressive fells. Aye Gill Pie on the right does not make the magic 2000 feet but Crag Hill to the left does and the Howgills in the distance have a number of the [Dales 30](https://www.dales30.co.uk) mountains in their undervalued range.\r\n\r\n**Find the View**\r\n\r\nThe walk up Whernside from Dent is described [here](https://where2walk.co.uk/walk/whernside-from-dent/). However this view can also be found from Whernside by extending the traditional climb by not crossing the stile and continuing on the bridleway towards Dent.\r\n\r\n**2\\. Littondale from track down to Halton Gill**\r\n\r\n[![Halton Gill approaches](https://where2walk.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Halton-Gill-approaches-800x420.jpg)](https://where2walk.co.uk/walk/hidden-valleys-of-wharfedale/)  \r\n*Halton Gill approaches*\r\n\r\nLittondale has always been my favourite dale. It is no surprise that many TV companies use the dale for their film locations. The latest is the James Herriot TV series. Littondale is rarely busy as there are no ‘popular’, over promoted hikes, and no waterfalls to entice the visitor. It is simply peaceful and serene, a place to lose yourself in nostalgia and tradition. Practically there are plenty of dry stone walls, sheep and three of the most lovely villages in the Dales.\r\n\r\nOne of 5 best views in the Yorkshire Dales appears at the head of the dale, on the track that leads in to the hamlet of Halton Gill from Yockenthwaite. The view looks down Littondale towards [Darnbrook Fell](https://where2walk.co.uk/walk/fountains-fell/) with the River Skirfare and Halton Gill in the foreground.\r\n\r\nRather than just park and walk up the bridleway above Halton Gill I strongly suggest to visitors spend time and take this [10 mile walk](https://where2walk.co.uk/walk/hidden-valleys-of-wharfedale/). As well as having one of the best views it is my favourite walk in the Yorkshire Dales. There is another excellent view on the walk out of Litton (the village) looking back over the attractive village and picture postcard scenery.\r\n\r\n**Find the View**\r\n\r\n[The walk details to find this view are here](https://where2walk.co.uk/walk/hidden-valleys-of-wharfedale)\r\n\r\n**3. Ingleborough Nature Reserve**\r\n\r\n[![Crummackdale limestone pavement](https://where2walk.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Crummackdale-limestone-pavement-800x420.jpg)](https://where2walk.co.uk/walk/austwick-and-crummackdale-walk/)\r\n*Crummackdale limestone pavement*\r\n\r\nOn the eastern slopes of Ingleborough lie the best preserved limestone pavements in England. The pavements are quite extensive, a sea (which of course it was) of light grey rock stretching many miles. Little walked paths wind their way through these pavements, pretty routes of short grass making the most of the pleasant underfoot terrain.\r\n\r\nThe best of the lot, with the iconic view, is a short section of the [Dales High Way](https://where2walk.co.uk/home/long-distance-walks/a-dales-high-way/) between Long Scar and Nick Pot, around 800m long. Half way along the path rises a little above the pavements to the east and the sea of limestone seems to stretch all the way to Pen-y-Ghent in the distance. All that interrupts the view are two Hawthorn trees in the midst of the rock. It is a perfect spot.\r\n\r\n**Find the View**\r\n\r\nThe path with the best views in this wonderful area of limestone pavements can be found on two walks: the [climb of Ingleborough](https://where2walk.co.uk/walk/ingleborough-and-gaping-gill/) and an [exploration of Crummackdale](https://where2walk.co.uk/walk/austwick-and-crummackdale-walk/).\r\n\r\n**4\\. Hay Meadows at Muker**\r\n\r\n[![Muker hay meadows](https://where2walk.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Muker-hay-meadows-800x420.jpg)](https://where2walk.co.uk/walk/hay-meadows-at-muker/)\r\n_Muker hay meadows_\r\n\r\nOne of the specialities of the Yorkshire Dales is the colourful Hay and Flower Meadows that carpet the valley floors during May and June. The views when standing in the meadows is unique. The local authorities have worked closely with local farmers to protect these fields and the development and protection of the hay meadows is the result. The meadows are increasingly widespread. However my favourite are the flower meadows in Upper Swaledale and more specifically around the village of Muker.\r\n\r\nThe village of Muker is a typical Dales village, small with a pleasant village pub set amongst beautiful Yorkshire stone buildings. The meadows are between the village and the embryonic River Swale. Having walked through the fields of hay meadows continue the walk alongside the river in to the valley to the north where there you will find a choice of paths.\r\n\r\n**Find the View**\r\n\r\n[The walk through the Hay Meadows is described here](https://where2walk.co.uk/walk/hay-meadows-at-muker/)\r\n\r\n**5\\. Cautley Spout from the slopes of Yarlside**\r\n\r\n[![Yarlside looking south](https://where2walk.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Yarlside-looking-south-800x420.jpg)](https://where2walk.co.uk/walk/yarlside/)\r\n*Yarlside looking south*\r\n\r\nStrictly this view is in the Cumbrian (not Yorkshire) Dales but as it is all part of the Yorkshire National Park it will do! The Howgills are an undervalued area for walking. If you do not know them, go and visit.\r\n\r\nThe best views of Cautley Spout is to climb the steep slopes of Yarlside from the Cross Keys temperance pub. The views across to the waterfalls are quite superb from the Yarlside climb, the highest cascade (multi drop) waterfall in England. From Yarlside you can see in to the depths of the waterfall with the slopes of the Calf above.\r\n\r\nFor those who cannot face the steep climb of Yarlside the track on the valley floor also yields excellent views of the waterfalls.\r\n\r\n**Find the View**\r\n\r\n[The climb of Yarlside to discover these views is here](https://where2walk.co.uk/walk/yarlside/)\r\n\r\n**An Honorary Mention**\r\n\r\n[![Long Preston Beck](https://where2walk.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/20210522_161421-800x420.jpg)](https://where2walk.co.uk/walk/eight-stiles-walk-around-long-preston/)\r\n_Long Preston Beck_\r\n\r\nThe area to the east of Long Preston has some outstanding views, particularly on the [8 Stiles walk](https://where2walk.co.uk/walk/eight-stiles-walk-around-long-preston/). Here the view back from the path above Long Preston Beck is a perfect scene, quintessentially English. Re-position this meeting of rivers near Malham and it would be heaving with visitors.\r\n\r\nTags:\r\n\r\n  #walks #where2walk #yorkshire #yorkshire-dales #the-dales #meadows #rivers #river-swale #river-skirfare #limestone #waterfalls #yorks-national-parks #yarlside #swaledale #mucker #villages #hay-meadows #yorkshire-mountains #mountains #james-herriot #tv-series ",

      "content": "Fascinating Moth Caterpillars\r\n\r\nCaterpillars come in various shapes, colors, and sizes, especially among moth species. Meet five remarkable moth caterpillars and discover what makes them unique.\r\n\r\n1. Puss Moth\r\n\r\n![Puss Moth Caterpillar](https://butterfly-conservation.org/sites/default/files/inline-images/Puss%20Moth%20caterpillar%20-%20Pete%20Withers.jpg)\r\n\r\nThe [Puss Moth](https://butterfly-conservation.org/moths/puss-moth) caterpillar features a chunky green body, long twin tails, and a large head. When threatened, it raises its head, displaying large eyespots to appear larger, and waves its tails, which have pinkish flagellae. If that fails, it can squirt formic acid at predators!\r\n\r\n2. Woolly Bear\r\n\r\n![Woolly Bear Caterpillar](https://butterfly-conservation.org/sites/default/files/styles/srcset_medium/public/2022-05/garden_tiger_moth_larva_chris_atkin.jpg)\r\n\r\nThe [Garden Tiger](https://butterfly-conservation.org/moths/garden-tiger) moth caterpillar, or Woolly Bear, is large and hairy, with a dense layer of ginger, black, and long white hairs. These hairs irritate potential predators and can also cause discomfort to humans, so it's best to avoid handling them.\r\n\r\n3. Elephant Hawk-moth\r\n\r\n![Elephant Hawk-moth Caterpillar](https://butterfly-conservation.org/sites/default/files/styles/srcset_medium/public/2018-12/5391198844-elephant-hawkmoth-caterpillar-deilephila-elpenor.jpg?itok=MDUjyi2P)\r\n\r\nThe [Elephant Hawk-moth](https://butterfly-conservation.org/moths/elephant-hawk-moth) caterpillar is one of the largest in the UK, named for its trunk-like appearance. When threatened, it can retract its head and swell its body, enhancing its eye spots to resemble a snake, deterring predators. Look for them in August and September.\r\n\r\n4. Early Thorn\r\n\r\n![Early Thorn Caterpillar](https://butterfly-conservation.org/sites/default/files/styles/srcset_medium/public/2019-03/3950419088_d6d85a3c56_o.jpg?itok=4jE1oRp3)\r\n\r\nThe [Early Thorn](https://butterfly-conservation.org/moths/early-thorn) caterpillar is a master of disguise, camouflaged to resemble twigs of native trees like hawthorn, birch, and hazel. Its mottled browns and knobbly protrusions help it blend into its surroundings, making it easy to overlook.\r\n\r\n5. Cinnabar\r\n\r\n![Cinnabar Caterpillar](https://butterfly-conservation.org/sites/default/files/styles/srcset_medium/public/2020-01/48241083172-tyria-jacobaeae-sint-jacobsvlinder.jpg?itok=f6YRqvIg)\r\n\r\nIn contrast, the Cinnabar Moth caterpillars are hard to miss with their vibrant yellow and black stripes, signaling their toxicity to predators. They accumulate toxins by feeding on Ragwort, and the adult moths mimic this warning coloration with their bold black and red patterns.\r\n",

      "content": " Create a Launcher for Bagels\r\n\r\nCreate a `.desktop` file. This file acts as a shortcut in your desktop environment and can execute scripts or commands directly. Here’s how to do it:\r\n\r\n## Steps to Create a Launcher for Bagels Commands\r\n\r\n**1. Write a Script for Bagels Commands**\r\n\r\nSince you want to run multiple commands (start, start with data, locate database, locate config), it's best to put them in a shell script and use a launcher to call that script. For example, create a file called `bagels_launcher.sh` in your home directory:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n#!/bin/bash\r\n\r\n# Simple menu to choose bagels command\r\nCHOICE=$(zenity --list --title=\"Bagels Launcher\" --column=\"Action\" \\\r\n    \"Start bagels\" \\\r\n    \"Start bagels with data at ./\" \\\r\n    \"Locate database\" \\\r\n    \"Locate config\")\r\n\r\ncase \"$CHOICE\" in\r\n    \"Start bagels\")\r\n        bagels\r\n        ;;\r\n    \"Start bagels with data at ./\")\r\n        bagels --at \"./\"\r\n        ;;\r\n    \"Locate database\")\r\n        bagels locate database\r\n        ;;\r\n    \"Locate config\")\r\n        bagels locate config\r\n        ;;\r\nesac\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Make this script executable:  \r\n  `chmod +x ~/bagels_launcher.sh`\r\n\r\n**2. Create a .desktop Launcher File**\r\n\r\nCreate a file named `Bagels.desktop` on your desktop or in `~/.local/share/applications/`:\r\n\r\n```ini\r\n[Desktop Entry]\r\nName=Bagels Launcher\r\nComment=Run various Bagels commands\r\nExec=/home/YOURUSERNAME/bagels_launcher.sh\r\nIcon=utilities-terminal\r\nTerminal=true\r\nType=Application\r\nCategories=Utility;\r\n```\r\n- Replace `/home/YOURUSERNAME/` with your actual home directory path.\r\n- Set `Terminal=true` if you want the commands to run in a terminal window (recommended for CLI tools)[1][5][7][9].\r\n\r\n**3. Make the Launcher Executable**\r\n\r\n- Right-click the `.desktop` file, go to Properties > Permissions, and check \"Allow executing file as program\"[7].\r\n- On some desktops, you may also need to right-click and select \"Allow Launching\"[7][10].\r\n\r\n**4. (Optional) Move the Launcher**\r\n\r\n- For system-wide access, move it to `~/.local/share/applications/`[7][9].\r\n- For easy desktop access, leave it on your desktop.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\n- You can customize the `Icon` line with a path to a custom icon if desired.\r\n- The script uses `zenity` for a graphical menu; install it with `sudo apt install zenity` if not present.\r\n- If you want separate launchers for each command, create multiple `.desktop` files with different `Exec` lines.\r\n\r\n## Example: Single Command Launcher\r\n\r\nFor just \"Start bagels\", your `.desktop` file would look like:\r\n\r\n```ini\r\n[Desktop Entry]\r\nName=Start Bagels\r\nExec=bagels\r\nIcon=utilities-terminal\r\nTerminal=true\r\nType=Application\r\nCategories=Utility;\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Summary Table\r\n\r\n| File                | Purpose                        | Exec Example                        |\r\n|---------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\r\n| Bagels.desktop      | Main launcher (menu)           | /home/you/bagels_launcher.sh        |\r\n| BagelsStart.desktop | Start bagels                   | bagels                              |\r\n| BagelsAt.desktop    | Start bagels with data at ./   | bagels --at \"./\"                    |\r\n| BagelsDB.desktop    | Locate database                | bagels locate database              |\r\n| BagelsCfg.desktop   | Locate config                  | bagels locate config                |\r\n\r\nThis approach ensures you can quickly launch any `bagels` command from your application menu or desktop[1][5][7][9].\r\n\r\n[1] https://wirekat.com/how-to-create-desktop-launchers-on-linux/\r\n[2] https://askubuntu.com/questions/141229/how-to-add-a-shell-script-to-launcher-as-shortcut\r\n[3] https://www.reddit.com/r/debian/comments/rum91j/how_to_create_a_bash_script_launcher_for_the/\r\n[4] https://forum.manjaro.org/t/help-create-custom-application-launchers/166362\r\n[5] https://www.tecmint.com/create-linux-desktop-launchers/\r\n[6] https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/\r\n[7] https://forum.zorin.com/t/custom-launcher-entries/11280\r\n[8] https://docs.vertica.com/24.2.x/en/vertica_doc.pdf\r\n[9] https://hackeradam.com/adding-a-custom-launcher-to-gnome-shell/\r\n[10] https://www.baeldung.com/linux/desktop-create-launchers",

In ''[[The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine]]'' (2006), Pappé writes that\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\"The systematic nature of Plan Dalet is manifested in Deir Yassin, a pastoral and cordial village that had reached a non-aggression pact with the Hagana in Jerusalem, but was doomed to be wiped out because it was within the areas designated in Plan Dalet to be cleansed.\"</blockquote>\r\n\r\nWalid Khalidi also emphasized \"the connection between the Haganah’s “Plan Dalet” [...] and what happened in Deir Yassin, explicitly linking the expulsion of the inhabitants to the Haganah’s overall planning.\"<ref>Morris 2005</ref> Khalidi states that the Haganah was involved in the attack on Deir Yassin through all stages, coordinating with and sending in the Irgun and Lehi forces, as well as participating in the fighting directly.{{refn|Morris 2005 \"The Haganah, argues Walid Khalidi, was deeply involved in Deir Yassin through all stages of the battle. It was the Jerusalem Haganah commander, David Shaltiel, who coordinated the attack with the IZL and LHI commanders and sent them on their way; the Haganah provided covering fire for the dissident troops as they advanced; Haganah units helped extricate the LHI-IZL wounded; and a small unit also participated in the fighting itself. The Haganah command, argues Khalidi, knew what was going on in the village “hour-by-hour,” blow by blow.

During the [[1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine]], in which Palestinian Arabs rose up against the British mandate authorities in protest at [[Aliyah|Jewish mass immigration]] into the country, Irgun's tactics had included bus and marketplace bombings, condemned by both the British and the Jewish Agency. Lehi, an Irgun splinter group, was formed in 1940 following Irgun's decision to declare a truce with the British during World War II. Lehi subsequently carried out a series of assassinations designed to force the British out of Palestine. In April 1948, it was estimated that the Irgun had 300 fighters in Jerusalem, and Lehi around 100.{{sfn|Silver|1984|p=89}}<ref>Hogan 2001</ref>\r\n\r\nBoth groups had committed numerous [[terrorism|terror attacks]] against the British and the Arabs and historian Matthew Hogan writes that:\r\n<blockquote>Another organizational ethos, deliberate terror, undoubtedly constituted a principal factor in the massacre. The Irgun's self-admitted operational tactics were \"terror, bombs, [and] assassination.\"</blockquote>\r\n\r\nDeir Yassin would be their first proper military operation and the groups were keen to show their rival, the Haganah, their combat prowess. The attack was the first joint operation between the groups since Lehi split from the Irgun in 1940.{{cn|date=April 2021}}\r\n\r\n=== Deir Yassin ===\r\n{{Main|Deir Yassin}}\r\n[[File:Deir Yassin family.jpg|thumb|A family from Deir Yassin, 1927]]\r\n[[File:DeirYassin1948.jpg|thumb|Deir Yassin and surrounds in 1948]]\r\nDeir Yassin was a [[Palestinian people|Palestinian Arab]] village of several hundred residents, all [[Muslim]], living in 144 houses.{{sfn|Khalidi|1992|p=290}} The [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] reported that there were 400 residents; [[Yoav Gelber]] writes that there were 610, citing the British mandatory authority figures; and Begin's biographer, Eric Silver, 800 to 1,000.<ref name=Gelber2006p309>[http://www.ee.bgu.ac.il/~censor/katz-directory/05-12-14gelber-palestine-1948-appendix-II-what-happened-in-deir-yassin-english.pdf Gelber 2006] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227114421/http://www.ee.bgu.ac.il/~censor/katz-directory/05-12-14gelber-palestine-1948-appendix-II-what-happened-in-deir-yassin-english.pdf |date=February 27, 2008 }}, p. 309.</ref> [[Walid Khalidi]] writes that the population was approximately 750.<ref>Walid Khalidi \"Deir Yassin\" (2003) [Arabic] https://archive.org/details/9.4.1948</ref>\r\n\r\nThe village was situated on a hill 800 meters above sea level{{sfn|Pappe|2006|p=90}} and two kilometers south of the Tel Aviv highway.<ref name=\"Hogan-2001\" /> It bordered West Jerusalem's Jewish suburbs; [[Givat Shaul]], an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] community, just across the valley 700 meters to the northeast,{{sfn|Milstein|1991|p=256}} and [[Beit HaKerem, Jerusalem|Beit HaKerem]] to the southeast.

The Lehi force was spearheaded by an armored vehicle with a loudspeaker.{{efn|Sources diverge on whether the armored vehicle was a \"truck\" or a \"car\".}} The plan was to drive the vehicle into the center of the village and blare a warning in Arabic, urging the residents to run towards Ein Karim.

I interviewed many of the women folk in order to glean some information on any atrocities committed in Deir Yassin but the majority of those women are very shy and reluctant to relate their experiences especially in matters concerning sexual assault and they need great coaxing before they will divulge any information. The recording of statements is hampered also by the hysterical state of the women who often break down many times whilst the statement is being recorded. There is, however, no doubt that many sexual atrocities were committed by the attacking Jews. Many young schoolgirls were raped and later slaughtered. Old women were also molested. One story is current concerning a case in which a young girl was literally torn in two. Many infants were also butchered and killed. I also saw one old woman who gave her age as one hundred and four who had been severely beaten about the head with rifle butts.

Milstein said there were contradictions in Pa'il's claims and an absence of any mention of Pa'il in other Haganah accounts of the incident. All Irgun and Lehi veterans Milstein interviewed denied having seen Pa'il in Deir Yassin, and the Lehi intelligence officer who Pa'il claimed invited him to Deir Yassin denied having done so. In addition, Haganah members who were in the area (including the deputy commander of the Palmach force that took part in the attack), some of whom personally knew Pa'il and were specifically mentioned in his account, denied having seen him there. According to Milstein, Pa'il said he despised the \"dissidents\", thus giving him a political motive to submit a falsified report. Milstein also wrote that Haganah intelligence reports on the incident were doctored by the authors or their superiors to discredit the Irgun and Lehi because of political in-fighting within the Jewish community.<ref>{{harvnb|Milstein|1998}}, pp. 366, 378, 382–388, cited in [https://books.google.com/books?id=uM_kFX6edX8C&pg=PA294 Morris 2004, footnote 564, p. 294]; also in an interview with Morris.</ref>\r\n\r\nMorris challenges Milstein's version that Pa'il was not at Deir Yassin that day with his observation that part of Pa'il's report, that he saw the bodies of five Arabs in a quarry, \"is apparently reinforced by a report by two Jewish doctors, who also report having found five male bodies in a house by the village quarry\".<ref name=Morris2004p238 /> In a presentation to the PEACE Middle East Dialog Group, Ami Isseroff, translator of Milstein's book into English, provided side-notes critical of many aspects of Milstein's work,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.israel-palestina.info/deir-yassin-uri-milsteins-account/|title=Deir Yassin – Uri Milstein's Account – translated by Ami Isseroff|author=Ami Isseroff|publisher=PEACE, a Mid-East Dialogue Group|year=1991|access-date=August 12, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170610042806/http://www.israel-palestina.info/deir-yassin-uri-milsteins-account/|archive-date=June 10, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> including much of his information about Pa'il and also about the incompleteness of his sources – \"Both Milstein and Yitzhak Levi leave out key testimony by Yehoshua Gorodenchik, from the Jabotinsky archives, in which he admits that Irgun troops murdered about 80 prisoners – mostly men – corresponding to accounts of refugees.\"\r\n\r\nPa'il, who died in 2015, defended himself in an interview in 2007: \"What the Lehi and Etzel [Irgun] people did in Deir Yassin in April 1948 was a despicable act. It cannot be called by any other name.\" He maintained that he was sent to Deir Yassin to gauge Lehi and Irgun's fighting capabilities which he found to be lacking: \"they didn't know a thing about field war. Worse, I saw that they knew how to massacre and kill... They are angry with me that I said these things. Let them first be angry at themselves.\" He also attacked Milstein for being \"a cheap propagandist for the right-wing considerations of the Zionist enterprise,\" adding angrily: \"I was there, I saw the massacre with my own eyes.

      "content": "Should Be Using\r\nZunaid Ali\r\n31–39 minutes\r\n13 Run the Previous Command With sudo\r\n\r\nWe’ve all been there. You type a command, hit Enter, and get a “Permission denied” message. You realize that you forgot to prefix it with sudo. Instead of retyping the whole thing, you can use a neat little trick:\r\n\r\nsudo !!\r\n\r\nThis tells the shell to rerun your last command, but this time, with sudo. The !! symbol is part of Bash history expansion. It expands to the entire previous command. So, if your last command was apt update, typing !! would effectively run apt update. And sudo !! becomes:\r\n\r\nsudo apt update\r\n\r\nUsing !! (double exclamation) with sudo to run the previous command with elevated privileges.\r\n\r\nIt’s a real time-saver, especially when you're deep into a workflow and forget to elevate privileges.\r\n12 Run Commands Without Leaving a Trace\r\n\r\nHere's an example of my command history.\r\nAn example of running Linux commands that get saved in the history.\r\n\r\nNow, after running a command starting with a space, it won't get added to the history.\r\nAn example of using space before a command prevents it from being saved in history.\r\n\r\nAs you can see, that last echo command is not to be found. This trick relies on a Bash feature called HISTCONTROL. By default, many systems have HISTCONTROL set to either ignorespace or ignoreboth. These settings tell Bash to ignore commands that start with a space when writing history.\r\n\r\nEver typed out a long file name, then needed to use it again in the next command? Instead of copying and pasting (or retyping,) just hit Alt+period (.) and it will insert the last argument from the previous command right where your cursor is. It works in most Bash shells, and it’s especially handy for commands that work on the same file or directory over and over.\r\n\r\nFor example, you might issue this command:\r\n\r\nmkdir really_long_directory_name_with_underscores\r\n\r\nThen you could type cd and hit Alt+. to change directories to the one you just made.\r\n\r\nAnother common situation where you may use this is when you extract a archive file and want to remove it. If you ran this command:\r\n\r\ntar -xvf archive_name.tar.gz\r\n\r\nYou could just type rm and press Alt+. to delete the archive. You can press this shortcut multiple times to cycle through previous arguments from earlier commands.\r\nLinux mascot on a desk next to a laptop.\r\n\r\nRelated\r\n10 Replace a Word With Another One in the Previous Command\r\n\r\n^wrong^right\r\n\r\nThis replaces the first occurrence of \"wrong\" in your previous command with \"right,\" and runs the updated command immediately. Let’s say you meant to ping google.com, but typed ping goggle.com mistakenly. Just do:\r\n\r\n^goggle^google\r\n\r\nBash will run:\r\n\r\nping google.com\r\n\r\nReplacing a word of the previous command with another one.\r\n\r\nThis can be useful when you have a quick typo to fix, and it occurred only once.\r\n9 Swap the Characters Before and After the Cursor\r\n\r\nIf you're a fast typist, you've probably mashed the wrong keys and typed something like:\r\n\r\nsl\r\n\r\nWhen you actually wanted to type:\r\n\r\nls\r\n\r\nYes, that’s such a common typo that there’s literally a command-line joke tool called sl that shows a train chugging across your screen.\r\n\r\ngrpe file.txt\r\n\r\nYou meant grep. Just place the cursor on the p, hit Ctrl+T, and it becomes:\r\n\r\ngrep file.txt\r\n\r\nIt’s a tiny trick that feels minor until you catch yourself using it 20 times a day.\r\n8 Using Aliases\r\n\r\nLet’s face it. Some Linux commands are just long. And when you're running them often, typing the same flags or full paths gets irritating. Not to mention error-prone. That’s where aliases come in. They allow you to create your own command shortcuts, using simple names for more complex or frequently used commands.\r\n\r\nCreating an alias is as simple as:\r\n\r\nalias shortname='actual command here'\r\n\r\nLet’s say you’re always running:\r\n\r\nls -lah --color=auto\r\n\r\nYou can quickly create an alias like this:\r\n\r\nalias ll='ls -lah --color=auto'\r\n\r\nAn example of using command aliases on Linux.\r\n7 Format Your Output in Columns\r\n\r\nOn Linux, we often need to work with data in the command line. Sometimes, the output can be quite messy. Luckily, we have the column command. It can turn that chaos into clean, readable tables of data. The column command formats text into neat columns, aligning things nicely based on whitespace or a custom delimiter. It's perfect when you're dealing with data like lists, CSV, colon-separated data, etc.\r\n\r\nLet's see a common example. We can normally list the processes on Linux with:\r\n\r\nps aux\r\n\r\nWe can format it further using the column command:\r\n\r\nps aux | head -10 | column -t\r\n\r\nAn example of using the column command to format Linux command output.\r\n6 Running Multiple Commands Consecutively\r\n\r\nSometimes you want to run several commands back to back. Instead of typing them one at a time and waiting, you can chain them together on a single line. Then, control whether they run unconditionally or only if the previous one succeeds.\r\n\r\nThe semicolon (;) lets you chain commands so they run one after the other, regardless of success or failure.\r\n\r\necho \"Updating...\" ; sudo apt update ; echo \"Done!\"\r\n\r\nRunning multiple Linux commands seperated by semicolons.\r\n\r\nIn this example, even if apt update fails, the final echo \"Done!\" still runs.\r\n\r\nsudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade\r\n\r\nThe command after && will only run if the command before it runs successfully. The opposite of && is the || (two vertical bars) operator. When two commands are combined using this symbol, the command on the right will execute only if the command on the left fails. Using && and || helps you debug issues with your Bash scripts.\r\nA hand using a laptop and Linux mascot coming out of the screen with a gear and some files behind.\r\n\r\nRelated\r\n5 Ways to Make Linux Commands Work the Way You Want\r\n\r\nYou don't really know the full power of Linux until you can tweak your toolset.\r\n5 Using Fingerprint Instead of a Password\r\n\r\nTyping your password every time you run sudo or unlock your screen? It's secure, but after doing it multiple times, it starts feeling tedious. If your laptop has a fingerprint reader, you can use it to authenticate instead of typing your password.\r\n\r\nFirst, install the necessary packages:\r\n\r\nsudo apt install fprintd libpam-fprintd\r\n\r\nAfter that, run this command to scan your fingerprint:\r\n\r\nfprintd-enroll\r\n\r\nThen open the PAM configuration file for sudo:\r\n\r\nsudo nano /etc/pam.d/sudo\r\n\r\nAdd this line at the top:\r\n\r\nauth sufficient pam_fprintd.so\r\n\r\nAdding fingerprint authentication for sudo on Linux.\r\n\r\nRun a command with sudo to test the fingerprint. The system will prompt you to scan your fingerprint instead of asking for a password.\r\n4 Go to the Previous Directory You Were In\r\n\r\nI often find myself jumping back and forth between two directories. Typing the full path repeatedly is annoying. So this neat little trick was a lifesaver for me:\r\n\r\ncd -\r\n\r\nThis command sends you to the previous working directory, just like a back button in your Linux file system. Let’s say you start in:\r\n\r\n/home/user/projects/website\r\n\r\nUsing the cd - command to jump between two directories.\r\n",

      "content": "Taking Silent Screenshots in XFCE (with Thunar)\r\n\r\nTo take silent screenshots in XFCE (the desktop environment Thunar is part of), you have several options depending on what exactly you want to silence: the notification popup, the shutter sound, or both.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Silencing Notification Popups**\r\n\r\nBy default, xfce4-screenshooter may show a notification popup after taking a screenshot. To suppress this:\r\n\r\n- Add the `--no-popup` option to the screenshot command.\r\n- Go to **Settings Manager > Keyboard > Application Shortcuts**.\r\n- Find the shortcut for taking screenshots (e.g., `xfce4-screenshooter -f`).\r\n- Edit the command to:  \r\n  ```\r\n  xfce4-screenshooter -f --no-popup\r\n  ```\r\nThis will prevent the infobox from appearing after each screenshot[8].\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Disabling the Screenshot Sound**\r\n\r\nIf your system plays a camera shutter sound when taking a screenshot, you can disable it without muting all system sounds:\r\n\r\n- Locate the sound file, usually at `/usr/share/sounds/freedesktop/stereo/camera-shutter.oga` or `/usr/share/sounds/freedesktop/stereo/screen-capture.oga`.\r\n- Rename or move the file to disable it:\r\n  ```\r\n  sudo mv /usr/share/sounds/freedesktop/stereo/camera-shutter.oga /usr/share/sounds/freedesktop/stereo/camera-shutter-backup.oga\r\n  ```\r\n- You may need to log out and log back in (or reboot) for the change to take effect[2][9].\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can generate a silent audio file to replace it if you prefer not to delete or move the original[2].\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Using Alternative Screenshot Tools**\r\n\r\nIf you want a tool that is silent by default and doesn't show popups, consider using `scrot`:\r\n\r\n- Install with:\r\n  ```\r\n  sudo apt-get install scrot\r\n  ```\r\n- Assign a keyboard shortcut to the command:\r\n  ```\r\n  scrot ~/Pictures/%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S-screenshot.png\r\n  ```\r\nThis will silently save a screenshot without any popup or sound[1].\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Summary Table**\r\n\r\n| Method                        | Popup Notification | Sound | Notes                                 |\r\n|-------------------------------|-------------------|-------|---------------------------------------|\r\n| xfce4-screenshooter --no-popup| No                | Yes*  | Add `--no-popup` to shortcut[8]       |\r\n| Rename sound file             | Yes               | No    | Move/rename `.oga` file[2][9]         |\r\n| Use scrot                     | No                | No    | Simple, silent CLI tool[1]            |\r\n\r\n*Disabling both popup and sound requires combining the above steps.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Thunar Note:**  \r\nThunar itself does not handle screenshots; it is just the file manager in XFCE. Screenshot functionality is managed by screenshot tools like xfce4-screenshooter, gnome-screenshot, or scrot[3].\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**In summary:**  \r\nTo take silent screenshots in XFCE, use `xfce4-screenshooter` with the `--no-popup` option and/or rename the shutter sound file. For a completely silent and no-popup experience, consider using `scrot` and assigning it to your Print Screen key[1][2][8][9].\r\n\r\n[1] https://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?t=181480\r\n[2] https://askubuntu.com/questions/140200/how-do-i-disable-the-screenshot-sound\r\n[3] https://docs.xfce.org/xfce/thunar/faq\r\n[4] https://www.reddit.com/r/xfce/comments/1dzex2h/how_to_unfullscreen_thunar/\r\n[5] https://forum.xfce.org/viewtopic.php?id=5128\r\n[6] https://kunalrustagi08.github.io/posts/2021/01/blog-post-3/\r\n[7] https://forum.endeavouros.com/t/thunar-my-biggest-problem/34877\r\n[8] https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/741786/disable-infobox-when-taking-screenshots-with-xfce-screenshooter\r\n[9] https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/93368/how-can-i-disable-the-shutter-sound-of-gnome-screenshot",

And in this post we will show you how to keep your USB port safe while playing around with speakers.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that the speaker offers resistance to the flow of electrons. And when dealing with DC, we call it resistance but when one is dealing with AC it goes by the name of impedance.\r\n\r\nBy virtue of Ohm’s law , we get:\r\n\r\n• Lower the impedance → more current → greater load → increased power\r\n• Raise the impedance → less current → smaller load → decreased power\r\n\r\nA general rule of thumb, small speakers (like the ones on your headphone) offer high resistance to the flow of hi current and larger ones offer little to no resistance.\r\n\r\nThis caused us an Arduino because we accidentally connected ~4 Ohm speaker to the Arduino. And due to its low impedance, it became power greedy and destroyed it while also temporarily shutting down the USB port. So, yet another thing that one must be careful about.\r\nHow to be careful ?\r\n\r\n[Understand Speaker impedance](https://geoffthegreygeek.com/understanding-speaker-impedance)\r\n",

So, the service file should reflect the correct script name and path.\r\n\r\n### Here's what you should do:\r\n\r\n1. **Update the service file** to match your script name:\r\n\r\n   Edit the systemd service file you created earlier (`/etc/systemd/system/rclone-mount.service`), and change the script path accordingly:\r\n\r\n   ```bash\r\n   sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/rclone-mount.service\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n   Update the `ExecStart` path to point to your `rclone.mount.gdrive1.sh` script:\r\n\r\n   ```ini\r\n   [Unit]\r\n   Description=Rclone Mount for Google Drive\r\n   After=network-online.target\r\n   Wants=network-online.target\r\n\r\n   [Service]\r\n   Type=simple\r\n   ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/rclone.mount.gdrive1.sh\r\n   ExecStop=/bin/fusermount -u /home/your-username/gdrive\r\n   Restart=on-failure\r\n   User=your-username\r\n   Group=your-username\r\n\r\n   [Install]\r\n   WantedBy=default.target\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. **Make sure the script is executable**:\r\n\r\n   Ensure that `rclone.mount.gdrive1.sh` is executable:\r\n\r\n   ```bash\r\n   sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/rclone.mount.gdrive1.sh\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n3. **Reload systemd**:\r\n\r\n   Now that you've updated the service file, reload systemd to make it aware of the changes:\r\n\r\n   ```bash\r\n   sudo systemctl daemon-reload\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n4. **Enable and start the service**:\r\n\r\n   Now, run the following commands to enable and start the service:\r\n\r\n   ```bash\r\n   sudo systemctl enable rclone-mount.service\r\n   sudo systemctl start rclone-mount.service\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n   You can also check the status to verify it's running:\r\n\r\n   ```bash\r\n   sudo systemctl status rclone-mount.service\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### TL;DR:\r\n\r\nMake sure the **script name** in the `ExecStart` line of the service file matches your actual script (`rclone.mount.gdrive1.sh`). Once you've done that, `sudo systemctl enable rclone-mount.service` should work.\r\n",

See the [https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/supportedsites.md list of supported sites]. \r\n\r\n{{Note|yt-dlp is a fork of [https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/ youtube-dl] that was created after the parent project became stagnant. The upstream youtube-dl can still be [[install]]ed as {{AUR|youtube-dl}}; commands on this page should still work, but check the [https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#differences-in-default-behavior list of differences].}}\r\n\r\n== Installation ==\r\n\r\n[[Install]] the {{Pkg|yt-dlp}} package, or {{AUR|yt-dlp-git}} for the development version. It is recommended to also install [[FFmpeg]] as it is used for muxing for some sites. See the optional dependencies. \r\n\r\nThere are also various [https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubedl/wiki/info-guis graphical frontends] to yt-dlp, such as {{AUR|tartube}} and {{AUR|yt-dlg-git}}. \r\n\r\nYou can also install {{AUR|yt-dlp-drop-in}} which provides a dummy {{ic|/usr/bin/youtube-dl}} executable (that just redirects to ''yt-dlp'') for outdated programs that still look for a ''youtube-dl'' executable.\r\n\r\n== Configuration ==\r\n\r\nThe system-wide configuration file is {{ic|/etc/yt-dlp.conf}} and the user-specific configuration file is {{ic|~/.config/yt-dlp/config}}. The syntax is simply one command-line option per line. Example configuration:\r\n\r\n --ignore-errors\r\n # --no-playlist\r\n \r\n # Save in ~/Videos\r\n -o ~/Videos/%(title)s.%(ext)s\r\n \r\n # Prefer 1080p or lower resolutions\r\n -f bestvideo[height<=?1080]+bestaudio/best\r\n\r\nSee [https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/README.md#configuration] for more information.\r\n\r\nA custom configuration file can also be specified with:\r\n\r\n $ yt-dlp ''URL'' --config-locations ''PATH''\r\n\r\n== Usage ==\r\n\r\nSee {{man|1|yt-dlp}} for the manual.\r\n\r\n $ yt-dlp [OPTIONS] ''URL''\r\n\r\n{{tip|In some cases (like YouTube) {{ic|''URL''}} can be substituted with the video ID.}}\r\n\r\n=== Format selection ===\r\n\r\nWhen multiple formats of a video are available, ''youtube-dl'' will download the best ones by default.\r\n\r\nTo get a list of the available formats:\r\n\r\n $ yt-dlp -F ''URL''\r\n\r\nTo select a specific one to download:\r\n\r\n $ yt-dlp -f ''format'' ''URL''\r\n\r\n=== Extract audio ===\r\n\r\nUse {{ic|-x}} for audio-only downloads (requires [[FFmpeg]]):\r\n\r\n $ yt-dlp -x -f bestaudio ''URL''\r\n\r\nDepending on the available source streams, this will often correct the audio-only container. If an audio-only stream is not available, exclude {{ic|-f bestaudio}} from the example above. This will download the video and copy its audio as post process. By default this will remove the downloaded video, include {{ic|-k}} to keep it.\r\n\r\nTo also include album art (requires {{Pkg|atomicparsley}}):\r\n\r\n $ yt-dlp -x -f bestaudio[ext=m4a] --add-metadata --embed-thumbnail ''URL''\r\n\r\n=== Subtitles ===\r\n\r\nTo see which languages are available:\r\n\r\n $ yt-dlp --list-subs ''URL''\r\n\r\nTo download a video with selected subtitles (comma separated):\r\n\r\n $ yt-dlp --write-sub --sub-lang ''LANG'' ''URL''\r\n\r\nFor auto-generated subtitles:\r\n\r\n $ yt-dlp --write-auto-sub --sub-lang ''LANG'' ''URL''\r\n\r\nAdd {{ic|--skip-download}} to get only subtitles.\r\n\r\n=== Cookies ===\r\n\r\nTo import cookies add the {{ic|--cookies-from-browser <browser>}}\r\n\r\nExample of importing cookies from chromium\r\n\r\n $ yt-dlp --cookies-from-browser chromium ''URL''\r\n\r\n== Tips and tricks ==\r\n\r\n=== Faster downloads ===\r\n\r\nSome websites throttle transfer speeds. You can often get around this by choosing non DASH streams or by using [[aria2]], an external downloader which supports multi-connection downloads. For example:\r\n\r\n $ yt-dlp --downloader aria2c --downloader-args '-c -j 3 -x 3 -s 3 -k 1M' ''URL''\r\n\r\n=== Playlist ===\r\n\r\nUsing youtube-dl for a playlist usually boils down to the following options:\r\n\r\n $ yt-dlp --ignore-errors --continue --no-overwrites --download-archive progress.txt ''usual options'' ''URL''\r\n\r\nThis set of options allow for the download to effectively continue even after interruption. If you are archiving, add the usual {{ic|--write-xxx}} and {{ic|--embed-xxx}} options you may have.\r\n\r\n=== Trim (partial download) ===\r\n\r\nParts of videos can be downloaded by using the output of {{ic|yt-dlp -g -f ''format'' ''URL''}} as ''ffmpeg'' input with the {{ic|-ss}} (for input), {{ic|-t}} and {{ic|-c copy}} [https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html#Main-options options].\r\n\r\n=== URL from clipboard ===\r\n\r\nA shell [[alias]], a [[desktop launcher]] or a keyboard shortcut can be set to download a video (or audio) of a selected (or copied) URL by outputting it from the [[Wikipedia:X_Window_selection|X selection]].

      "content": "List and Filter Fonts With ‘fc-list’\r\n\r\nfc-list | grep\r\n\r\nThe command fc-list | grep is used in a Unix-like operating system to list available fonts and filter the output based on a specific search term.\r\n\r\nHere’s a breakdown of the command:\r\n\r\n    fc-list: This command lists all the fonts available on the system. It provides details about each font, including its file path and other metadata.\r\n\r\n    |: is a pipe operator that takes the output of the command on its left (fc-list) and uses it as the input for the command on its right (grep).\r\n\r\n    grep: This command is used to search for specific patterns in the input it receives. However, in this case, the command is incomplete because grep requires a search term or pattern to filter the output.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you wanted to find all fonts that contain the word “Arial,” you would use the cmd like this:\r\n\r\nfc-list | grep Arial\r\n\r\nThis would list all the fonts that include “Arial” in their names or paths. Without a search term, the command as it stands will not produce any meaningful output.\r\n\r\nfc-list Options\r\n\r\n    Filtering by Pattern: You can specify a pattern to filter the fonts listed. For example:\r\n\r\n    fc-list : family | grep Arial\r\n    This would list only the font families that match “Arial.”\r\n\r\n    Output Formatting: You can customize the output format using the : syntax. For example:\r\n    fc-list : family, style\r\n    This command will list the font families along with their styles.\r\n\r\n    Specifying a Directory: You can limit the search to a specific directory containing font files:\r\n    fc-list /path/to/fonts\r\n\r\n    Listing Font Properties: List specific properties of fonts, like family, style, file path. For example:\r\n    fc-list : family, style, file\r\n\r\n    Using Environment Variables: You can set environment variables to influence the behavior of fc-list, such as FONTPATH, which specifies additional directories to search for fonts.\r\n\r\n    Check Font Presence: Without displaying the entire font list (or any pattern) using fc-list in Bash\r\n    fc-list | grep -q \"Arabic\" && echo \"Font is present.\" || echo \"Font is not present.\"\r\n\r\n    💡Tip: You can condense the below multi line bash cmd, into a single line bash cmd like above using the && and || operators, known as Logical Operators used to combine conditions\r\n\r\n    if fc-list | grep -q \"Arabic\"; then\r\n\r\necho “Font is present.”\r\nelse\r\necho “Font is not present.”\r\nfi\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile `fc-list` is focused on font management, its options allow for a variety of ways to query and display font information, making it a versatile tool for working with fonts on a system. However, it does not perform functions unrelated to font management.\r\n",

Would we use another AI model for comfort research information?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI like how you used multi prompting to get what you want, but how can you verify these informations you are getting are facts? If we can't verify the source, all chatgpt is doing is getting response from its training data which can be most of the time includes biases and hallucinations\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI recommend you experiment more and have a more conversations with an ai particularly chatGPT4o.\r\nPs: What you've said about broken links is a newbie problem. Try checking one of my stories. It's easy to prompt the ai to get informations from research papers reviewed by experts with clickable links\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThere are many ways of doing that, provided you are using the AI as a tool and not an author. You are right, hallucinations happen all the time, especially over long subjects, so one good idea can be as simple as asking it to “How did you come down to this? Could you explain me your cha\r\nin of thought?” \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you need references, it will usually provide them, but it is up to you whether you will blindly believe an hallucination-prone chatbot or double check and proofread your stuff 🙃\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nPs: academic reference links from ChatGPT are often broken. It’s quite funny to point that out directly to your assistant. It is “natural” for a LLM to suppose you won’t double check a link when it’s getting hard for it to find the way you asked it to do, so it will throw whatever comes closer",

It is estimated that around 60 million shells rained down near Verdun during the fierce battles over that city in 1916 – of which 15 million didn’t explode upon impact.\r\n\r\nFour years of war stripped a zone on either side of the largely immobile frontline of any sign of life. Roads and bridges, canals and railways were destroyed. Cities were pummeled into dust. Entire villages ‘died for France’ and were wiped off the map for good.\r\n\r\nBombardments were so thorough that even grass and trees disappeared. When the war ended in November 1918, a large swathe of northern to eastern France was so cratered up and chewed out that it looked like a moonscape. In all, about 7 percent of French territory was destroyed during the war, in a zone stretching over 4,000 municipalities across 13 departments, from the Nord at the coast to the Bas-Rhin on the Swiss border.\r\n\r\nBy 1919, the French Ministry for the Liberated Territories had divided the afflicted areas into three zones, depending on the degree of destruction:\r\n\r\n-   *Zones vertes* (‘Green Zones’), with minimal damage;\r\n-   *Zones jaunes* (‘Yellow Zones’), with heavy but limited damage; and\r\n-   *Zones rouges* (‘Red Zones’), usually closest to the former front lines, which were completely destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe primary task was to clear the affected areas of ammunition and corpses. This involved the efforts of German PoWs, foreign workers from as far afield as China, and Quaker volunteers, among others.\r\n\r\nMassive amounts of unidentified human remains were gathered in places like the Douaumont Ossuary, the last resting place of 130,000 German and French soldiers who fell at Verdun. Soldier bones continue to turn up. As recently as April 2012, authorities were able to identify the remains of a French soldier named Albert Dadure.\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Kx0Z6ma.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe total area of the Red Zones has shrunk since 1919, but they still add up to the size of Paris. \r\n\r\nThe green and yellow zones were returned to civilian use relatively early. The red zones were different. They were, in the words of one official post-war report, “completely devastated. Damage to properties: 100%. Damage to agriculture: 100%. Impossible to clean. Human life impossible.” Red zones were cleared only superficially, and mostly just closed off.\r\n\r\nIn 1919, these red zones covered around 690 square miles (1,800 km2). Here, the ground remained saturated with unexploded ordnance. High concentrations of heavy metals and chemicals in the soil further increased the risk to life and limb. For reasons of safety and sanitation, these areas were strictly off-limits for housing, farming, and even forestry.\r\n\r\nBy 1927, the red zones had been reduced by 70 percent to around 190 square miles (490 km2), in part due to pressure from local farmers, who wanted to return their fields and pastures to productivity and profit.\r\n\r\nToday, the red zone archipelago has shrunk to about 40 square miles (100 km2), about the size of Paris. Yet it’s unlikely that these islands will disappear soon. They are the most tenacious residue of a long-lasting environmental problem.\r\n\r\nEach year, farmers in former red zones plough up an ‘iron harvest’ of close to 900 tons of unexploded ordnance. Near Verdun, road signs point to dumping grounds where they can leave these shells for the authorities to collect.\r\n\r\nFrance’s *Sécurité Civile*, which is charged with removing them, estimates that at current rates, it could take up to 700 years to completely clear all remaining WWI shells and grenades from France’s soil.\r\n\r\nAnd then there are the gases, acids, and other chemicals polluting the soil – in some parts, the ground still contains so much arsenic that nothing will grow. In less affected areas, biologists still note the lack of floral and faunal diversity related to the pollution, which some estimate may take about 10,000 years to clear.\r\n\r\n![](https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/25618348.jpg?w=635)\r\n\r\nForeground: Verdun battlefield kept clear of vegetation to show the battle scars on the landscape. Background: Verdun Forest, as it has emerged after WWI.\r\n\r\nWWI was supposed to be the ‘War to End All War’. That went… less well than could have been hoped for. One of the lessons not learned from that conflict is that modern wars have long-lasting impacts on health and the environment. The issue has remained largely dormant, resurfacing only in the 1990s, when more than 1 in 3 U.S. veterans of the First Gulf War reported a range of symptoms ascribed to exposure to toxic substances.\r\n\r\nEven in France itself, not much thought is given to the lingering effects of WWI, or to the remaining Zones rouges – perhaps because so much of the affected areas were left to the trees, becoming so-called forêts de guerre (war forests), notably in the Champagne region. Yet the invisible environmental legacy of the Great War has very real consequences.\r\n\r\n-   In 2012, the consumption of locally sourced drinking water was prohibited in 544 municipalities, due to high levels of perchlorate, which was used to make WWI ammo. All of those municipalities are located close to former battlefield zones.\r\n-   Experts warn that mushrooms, game meat, and even food cooked over wood collected in red zones or former red zones might be a source of toxins.\r\n-   It has been established that the livers of wild boars roaming the forests around Verdun contain abnormally high levels of lead.\r\n-   And the relatively elevated levels of lead in certain French wines may result from the wood of the barrels in which they matured, from oak harvested in former red zones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

While many of these apps are useful to the functionality of the device, others keep running in the background hogging the CPU, battery, and mobile data. To ensure optimal performance, we must uninstall the bloatware. With the help of ADB, you can uninstall useless system apps on Huawei and Honor phones.\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\nWhile some OEM apps are visible in the app drawer, many keep running in the background stealthily. Such apps play a big role in draining your phone’s battery and slowing down the device’s performance. Since manufacturers disable the uninstall option for most pre-installed apps, we can’t uninstall them from app settings. Luckily, there are ADB commands that make the job easy by letting us disable, freeze, and uninstall them without root.\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\n## Huawei & Honor Bloatware List on EMUI\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\nWhile the procedure to remove bloatware on all Android devices is the same, the apps and app packages differ depending on the OEM, Android version, and skin. With that said, here is a detailed list of bloatware on Huawei and Honor running EMUI. These apps are safe to remove but you must not uninstall the apps you use.\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\n### Huawei EMUI Built-in Apps\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\ncom.baidu.input_huawei | Chinese keyboard\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\ncom.huawei.appmarket | Huawei Market app\r\n\r\nDownload\r\n",

      "content": "\r\nRecently, [photographer](https://uniliroc.com/photographs-of-the-beautiful-lily-harvest-through-the-camera-lens-of-phan-huy-trung/) Pablo Iglesias Maurer stumbled upon an old matchbook on his desk that immediately caught his attention. The matchbook featured a postcard-like image of a resort complex from the 1960s, prompting Pablo’s curiosity about its current state. This curiosity led him to embark on an incredible photo series titled “Abandoned States.”\r\n\r\nOne particular vintage photo titled “How to Run A Successful Golf Course” piqued Pablo’s interest, and he decided to visit the location depicted in the image. However, upon arrival, it became apparent that the owner of Penn Hills Resort had not followed the advice given in the photo’s title. Undeterred, Pablo set up his camera at a similar angle and captured a “5-decades-after” shot of the abandoned resort.\r\n\r\nThis experience sparked a deep fascination within Pablo, prompting him to search for more 1960s photo postcards on eBay. Armed with these vintage images, he embarked on a cross-country journey, capturing present-day photos of these once-beautiful buildings that now stand abandoned, serving as mere echoes of their former glory.\r\n\r\nPablo acknowledges the inherent haziness and idealized nature of the vintage postcards, acknowledging that the depicted places were never as idyllic as they appeared. Aligning the modern-day shots with the vintage postcards can be challenging, but over time, the differences blur, bringing the past and present into sharp focus.\r\n\r\nThe resulting series of then and now-photographs showcases the remarkable contrast between the past and the present, capturing the haunting beauty of these abandoned locations.\r\n\r\nMore info: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AbandonedStates) | [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/pablomaurer/?hl=en) | [DCist](https://dcist.com/story/17/08/30/abandoned-postcards-poconos-catskills-animations/) \r\n\r\n**1.

      "content": "I found the old matchbook lying on a desk, writes Pablo Maurer. It was buried under some papers, beside a thick, water-logged book frozen solid in the January chill. I ran my fingers down its spine and read the title: “How to Run A Successful Golf Course.”\r\n\r\nThe owner of the Penn Hills Resort in the Poconos probably hadn’t followed whatever advice the author had to offer. They boarded the place up years ago, and there’s a gaping hole in the roof of his old office. Muted greens and yellows, shag carpeting peek at me through a sheet of ice.\r\n\r\nThe matchbook, which looks to be from the 60s, is about half empty – whoever was sitting here when this place finally went under surely needed a smoke.\r\n\r\n[![On the inside of the matchbook, some text: \"Swim n' Sun Indoor Swimming Pool at Penn Hills Lodge and Cottages. The Poconos' Finest Modern Resort.\" ![image](https://flashbak.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Abandoned-postcards-matches.gif)\r\n\r\nOn the inside of the matchbook, some text: “Swim n’ Sun Indoor Swimming Pool at Penn Hills Lodge and Cottages. The Poconos’ Finest Modern Resort.” (Photograph by Pablo Iglesias Maurer, matchbook publisher unknown.)\r\n\r\nIts cover is a reminder of better days. Swimmers are frolicking at the resort’s indoor pool, now a scene of trash, mangled deck chairs, a life preserver. I lock eyes with a huge bullfrog who didn’t make it out. He was entombed in the ice.\r\n\r\nThe matchbook no longer lines up with reality. I look down through the viewfinder of my camera and up again at the matchbook, aligning the two images the best I can. Up (snap) down (snap). It feels like I’m seeing this place in some sort of dystopian View-Master, each image on the wheel darker than the next.\r\n\r\nWeeks later, I score a cache of old postcards from the Poconos and Catskills on eBay, the sort that end up in family albums, stuck in some box in the attic. “Our Honeymoon.” In idyllic scenes at Penn Hills, The Homowack Lodge, Grossinger’s, and a fourth resort in the Poconos which we aren’t identifying, vacation-goers and honeymooners frolic in the mountains.\r\n\r\nThey have a surreal quality. Ephemeral, disposable, they served only one purpose—to let someone know “I’m here. I’m thinking of you.” It feels a bit like social media does sometimes, where you’ll snap a photo of some vista, sometimes to bring those you care about a bit closer to you. And like social media, the postcards manage to be a little impersonal: “I didn’t quite care enough to write a letter.” It’s analog Foursquare, a non-digital check-in.\r\n\r\nOver the past few years, I’ve gone back to the places in the postcards.\r\n\r\nOn Christmas Day a couple years back, I went into an abandoned bowling alley in the Catskills, stood up some pins and bowled a couple of frames. That signature sound—the pins caroming about—sounds a lot different in a place like that. There are echoes of the postcard, where a bear of a man stands at the shoe rental counter. No shoes now, no phone, no counter.\r\n\r\nMore of the indoor pool at Grossinger's. The tiled floor was heated, the entire structure air conditioned. Above, beautiful mid-century \"sputnik\" chandeliers cast a glow on the swimmers below. Below the pool are exercise rooms, a gym, salon and a host of other amenities. The pool has sat vacant since the late 90's and has fallen beyond repair. ![](https://flashbak.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Abandoned-postcards-grossingers2.gif)\r\n\r\nOther times, the search is a bit more challenging.\r\n\r\nI trudged through an old resort in the Poconos last year, just a few months after a fire burned half the place down. In the postcard, a couple poses in front of a gazebo. Now, it’s just a pit in the ground. Time is a sink hole.\r\n\r\nPhotos of abandonment tend to be a bit stylized, painting decay with a nostalgic brush. The postcards, too, have their own haze—the places were never as nice as they look. I often struggle to get the two images to line up, as well. But time blurs the difference, and brings everything into focus.\r\n\r\n![A lane attendant at the Homowack lodge in the Catskills.

Elizabeth Taylor attended the pool's opening, and Florence Chadwick - the first woman to swim the English Channel in both directions - took the first dip in it. From Ross Padluck's excellent \"Lost Architecture of Paradise\"...The new indoor pool at Grossinger's was the zenith of the Catskills. Nothing quite like it had ever been built, and nothing ever would be again. It represented everything about the Catskills in the 1950s-style: extravagance, luxury, modernism and celebrity.\" \r\n\r\n![](https://flashbak.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Abandoned-postcards-GrossingersPool.gif)\r\n\r\n[![The Homowack Lodge now sits abandoned on the southern edge of the famed \"Borscht Belt.\" On its lower level, maybe the highlight of the place, a four-lane Brunswick bowling alley. It has seen better days. The resort closed in the mid-2000's but lived on briefly, first as a Hasidic resort and lastly as the site of a summer camp—one which was forced to shut down after the NY Department of Environmental Conservation deemed it uninhabitable.

It was one of the most fatal pandemics in human history; as many as 50 million people[2] perished, perhaps 50% of Europe's 14th century population.[3] The disease is caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis and spread by fleas and through the air.[4][5] One of the most significant events in European history, the Black Death had far-reaching population, economic, and cultural impacts. It was the beginning of the second plague pandemic.[6] The plague created religious, social and economic upheavals, with profound effects on the course of European history.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the Black Death is disputed.[7] Genetic analysis suggests Yersinia pestis bacteria evolved approximately 7,000 years ago, at the beginning of the Neolithic,[8] with flea-mediated strains emerging around 3,800 years ago during the late Bronze Age.[9] The immediate territorial origins of the Black Death and its outbreak remain unclear, with some evidence pointing towards Central Asia, China, the Middle East, and Europe.[10][11] The pandemic was reportedly first introduced to Europe during the siege of the Genoese trading port of Kaffa in Crimea by the Golden Horde army of Jani Beg in 1347. From Crimea, it was most likely carried by fleas living on the black rats that travelled on Genoese ships, spreading through the Mediterranean Basin and reaching North Africa, West Asia, and the rest of Europe via Constantinople, Sicily, and the Italian Peninsula.[12] There is evidence that once it came ashore, the Black Death mainly spread from person-to-person as pneumonic plague, thus explaining the quick inland spread of the epidemic, which was faster than would be expected if the primary vector was rat fleas causing bubonic plague.[13][14][15] In 2022, it was discovered that there was a sudden surge of deaths in what is today Kyrgyzstan from the Black Death in the late 1330s; when combined with genetic evidence, this implies that the initial spread may have been unrelated to the 14th century Mongol conquests previously postulated as the cause.[16][17] ",

In the issue of *[Nature Genetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_Genetics \"Nature Genetics\")* published online Sunday, they conclude that all three of the great waves of plague originated from China, where the root of their tree is situated. ... The likely origin of the plague in China has nothing to do with its people or crowded cities, Dr. Achtman said. The bacterium has no interest in people, whom it slaughters by accident. Its natural hosts are various species of rodent such as marmots and voles, which are found throughout China.\r\n81.  **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Death#cite_ref-FOOTNOTEMorelliSongMazzoniEppinger2010_84-0 \"Jump up\")** [Morelli et al. 2010](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Death#CITEREFMorelliSongMazzoniEppinger2010).\r\n82.  **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Death#cite_ref-pmid29073248_85-0 \"Jump up\")** Eroshenko GA, Nosov NY, Krasnov YM, Oglodin YG, Kukleva LM, Guseva NP, et al.

In 1346, the attacking army experienced an epidemic of bubonic plague. The Italian chronicler Gabriele de' Mussi, in his *Istoria de Morbo sive Mortalitate quae fuit Anno Domini 1348*, describes quite plausibly how plague was transmitted by the Mongols by throwing diseased cadavers with catapults into the besieged city, and how ships transporting Genovese soldiers, fleas and rats fleeing from there brought it to the Mediterranean ports. Given the highly complex epidemiology of plague, this interpretation of the Black Death (which might have killed >25 million people in the following years throughout Europe) as stemming from a specific and localized origin of the Black Death remains controversial. Similarly, it remains doubtful whether the effect of throwing infected cadavers could have been the sole cause of the outburst of an epidemic in the besieged city.\"\r\n98.  **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Death#cite_ref-101 \"Jump up\")** Byrne JP (2012). \"Caffa (Kaffa, Fyodosia), Ukraine\".

This tool is particularly handy for developers who want a more visually appealing and efficient command-line experience.\r\nKey Features of colorls\r\n\r\n• Color-Coded Output: File types are color-coded for better readability.\r\nFile Icons: Icons appear next to file names, making it easier to identify directories, image files, scripts, and more.  \r\n\r\n• Customizable Configuration: Modify color schemes, icon sets, and behaviors using a configuration file.  \r\n\r\n• Tree View: Display your directory structure in a tree format with just one command.\r\n\r\n• Sorting and Filtering: Easily sort files by size, time, or extension, and filter hidden files or specific file types.\r\n\r\nInstalling colorls\r\n\r\n• Install Ruby (if not on your system)\r\n\r\n`sudo apt install ruby`\r\n\r\n• Install the colorls Gem\r\n\r\n`gem install colorls`  \r\n\r\nIf you get `Error installing colorls` after installing, install ruby dev.\r\n\r\n`install ruby-dev`\r\n\r\n• Install Nerd Fonts https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads \r\nTo display file icons correctly, install a Nerd Font like Hack Nerd.  \r\n\r\n• Create an Alias:\r\n\r\nTo make it easier to use, create a short alias for the colorls command. Open your shell configuration file (e.g., ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc) and add the following line:\r\n\r\n`  alias cls='colorls'  `\r\n\r\n- Reload your shell config:\r\n\r\n` source ~/.bashrc `  or  ` source ~/.zshrc `\r\n\r\nNow, instead of typing colorls, you can use `cls` \r\n\r\n**How to Use colorls**\r\n\r\nHere are some common options for colorls:\r\n\r\n1. Basic Directory Listing  \r\n\r\n`colorls`\r\n\r\n2. Detailed Output: Similar to `ls -l` this displays file permissions, sizes, and modification times:  \r\n\r\n`colorls -l`\r\n\r\n3. Show Hidden Files: Use the -a flag to include hidden files (similar to ls -a):\r\n\r\n`colorls -a`\r\n\r\n4. Tree View: Display the directory structure in a tree format:\r\n\r\n`colorls --tree`\r\n\r\n5. Sort by File Size: To sort files by size, use:\r\n\r\n`colorls --sd`\r\n\r\n**Customizing colorls**\r\n\r\ncolorls can be customized using a YAML configuration file. To locate the configuration file, run:\r\n\r\n`colorls --config-file`\r\n\r\nOpen this file in your favorite text editor and tweak it to match your preferences. You can change colors, icons, and file type associations.\r\nWhy Use colorls?\r\n\r\n>Enhanced Readability: Quickly identify file types and important files.\r\nVisual Appeal: Makes working in the terminal more enjoyable.\r\nIncreased Efficiency: Improved organization speeds up file navigation.\r\n\r\n**Uninstalling colorls**\r\n\r\nIf you decide to remove colorls, you can uninstall it easily by running:\r\n\r\n`gem uninstall colorls`\r\n\r\nFinal Thoughts\r\n\r\ncolorls is a fantastic tool for anyone who spends a lot of time in the terminal. It turns mundane directory listings into a visually appealing experience while improving efficiency and readability. Whether you're a developer, system administrator, or casual terminal user, colorls is worth exploring.",

      "content": "Quick Guide To Write Scripts In Bash\r\n\r\n**A simple shell script**\r\n\r\nA shell script is little more than a list of commands that are run in sequence. Conventionally, a shellscript should start with a line such as the following:\r\n\r\n> `#!/bin/bash`\r\n\r\nTHis indicates that the script should be run in the bash shell regardless of which interactive shell the user has chosen. This is very important, since the syntax of different shells can vary greatly.\r\n\r\n**A simple example**\r\n\r\nHere's a very simple example of a shell script. It just runs a few simple commands\r\n\r\n> `#!/bin/bash echo \"hello, $USER. I wish to list some files of yours\" echo \"listing files in the current directory, $PWD\" ls  # list files`\r\n\r\nFirstly, notice the comment on line 4. In a bash script, anything following a pound sign # (besides the shell name on the first line) is treated as a comment. ie the shell ignores it. It is there for the benifit of people reading the script.\r\n\r\n$USER and $PWD are _variables_. These are standard variables defined by the bash shell itself, they needn't be defined in the script. Note that the variables are _expanded_ when the variable name is inside double quotes. Expanded is a very appropriate word: the shell basically sees the string $USER and replaces it with the variable's value then executes the command.\r\n\r\nWe continue the discussion on variables below ...\r\n\r\n**Variables**\r\n\r\nAny programming language needs variables. You define a variable as follows:\r\n\r\n> `X=\"hello\"`\r\n\r\nand refer to it as follows:\r\n\r\n> `$X`\r\n\r\nMore specifically, $X is used to denote the value of the variable X. Some things to take note of regarding semantics:\r\n\r\n*   bash gets unhappy if you leave a space on either side of the = sign. For example, the following gives an error message:\r\n    \r\n    > `X = hello`\r\n    \r\n*   while I have quotes in my example, they are not always necessary. where you need quotes is when your variable names include spaces. For example,\r\n    \r\n    > `X=hello world # error   X=\"hello world\" # OK`\r\n    \r\n\r\nThis is because the shell essentially sees the command line as a pile of commands and command arguments seperated by spaces. `foo=bar`is considered a command. The problem with `foo = bar` is the shell sees the word `foo` seperated by spaces and interprets it as a command. Likewise, the problem with the command `X=hello world` is that the shell interprets `X=hello` as a command, and the word \"world\" does not make any sense (since the assignment command doesn't take arguments).\r\n\r\n**Single Quotes versus double quotes**\r\n\r\nBasically, variable names are exapnded within double quotes, but not single quotes. If you do not need to refer to variables, single quotes are good to use as the results are more predictable.\r\n\r\n**An example**\r\n\r\n> `#!/bin/bash echo -n '$USER=' # -n option stops echo from breaking the line echo \"$USER\" echo \"\\$USER=$USER\"  # this does the same thing as the first two lines`\r\n\r\nThe output looks like this (assuming your username is elflord)\r\n\r\n> `$USER=elflord   $USER=elflord`\r\n\r\nso the double quotes still have a work around. Double quotes are more flexible, but less predictable. Given the choice between single quotes and double quotes, use single quotes.\r\n\r\n**Using Quotes to enclose your variables**\r\n\r\nSometimes, it is a good idea to protect variable names in double quotes. This is usually the most important if your variables value either (a) contains spaces or (b) is the empty string. An example is as follows:\r\n\r\n> `#!/bin/bash X=\"\" if [ -n $X ]; then \t# -n tests to see if the argument is non empty \techo \"the variable X is not the empty string\" fi`\r\n\r\nThis script will give the following output:\r\n\r\n> `the variable X is not the empty string`\r\n\r\nWhy ? because the shell expands $X to the empty string. The expression \\[ -n \\] returns true (since it is not provided with an argument). A better script would have been:\r\n\r\n> `#!/bin/bash X=\"\" if [ -n \"$X\" ]; then \t# -n tests to see if the argument is non empty \techo \"the variable X is not the empty string\" fi`\r\n\r\nIn this example, the expression expands to \\[ -n \"\" \\] which returns false, since the string enclosed in inverted commas is clearly empty.\r\n\r\n**Variable Expansion in action**\r\n\r\nJust to convince you that the shell really does \"expand\" variables in the sense I mentioned before, here is an example:\r\n\r\n> `#!/bin/bash LS=\"ls\" LS_FLAGS=\"-al\"  $LS $LS_FLAGS $HOME`\r\n\r\nThis looks a little enigmatic. What happens with the last line is that it actually executes the command\r\n\r\n> `ls -al /home/elflord`\r\n\r\n(assuming that /home/elflord is your home directory). That is, the shell simply replaces the variables with their values, and then executes the command.\r\n\r\n**Using Braces to Protect Your Variables**\r\n\r\nOK. Here's a potential problem situation. Suppose you want to echo the value of the variable X, followed immediately by the letters \"abc\". Question: how do you do this ? Let's have a try :\r\n\r\n> `#!/bin/bash X=ABC echo \"$Xabc\"`\r\n\r\nTHis gives no output. What went wrong ? The answer is that the shell thought that we were asking for the variable Xabc, which is uninitialised. The way to deal with this is to put braces around X to seperate it from the other characters. The following gives the desired result:\r\n\r\n> `#!/bin/bash X=ABC echo \"${X}abc\"`\r\n\r\n**Conditionals, if/then/elif**\r\n\r\nSometimes, it's necessary to check for certain conditions. Does a string have 0 length ? does the file \"foo\" exist, and is it a symbolic link , or a real file ? Firstly, we use the if command to run a test. The syntax is as follows:\r\n\r\n> `if _condition_ then \t_statement1_ \t_statement2_ \t.......... fi`\r\n\r\nSometimes, you may wish to specify an alternate action when the condition fails. Here's how it's done.\r\n\r\n> `if _condition_ then \t_statement1_ \t_statement2_ \t.......... else \t_statement3_ fi`\r\n\r\nalternatively, it is possible to test for another condition if the first \"if\" fails. Note that any number of elifs can be added.\r\n\r\n> `if _condition1_ then \t_statement1_ \t_statement2_ \t.......... elif _condition2_ then \t_statement3_ \t_statement4_ \t........     elif _condition3_ then \t_statement5_ \t_statement6_ \t........       fi`\r\n\r\nThe statements inside the block between `if/elif` and the next `elif` or `fi` are executed if the corresponding condition is true. Actually, any command can go in place of the conditions, and the block will be executed if and only if the command returns an exit status of 0 (in other words, if the command exits \"succesfully\" ). However, in the course of this document, we will be only interested in using \"test\" or \"\\[ \\]\" to evaluate conditions.\r\n\r\n**The Test Command and Operators**\r\n\r\nThe command used in conditionals nearly all the time is the test command. Test returns true or false (more accurately, exits with 0 or non zero status) depending respectively on whether the test is passed or failed. It works like this:\r\n\r\n> `test _operand1 operator operand2_`\r\n\r\nfor some tests, there need be only one operand (operand2) The test command is typically abbreviated in this form:\r\n\r\n> `[ _operand1 operator operand2_ ]`\r\n\r\nTo bring this discussion back down to earth, we give a few examples:\r\n\r\n> `#!/bin/bash X=3 Y=4 empty_string=\"\" if [ $X -lt $Y ]\t# is $X less than $Y ?  then \techo \"\\$X=${X}, which is smaller than \\$Y=${Y}\" fi  if [ -n \"$empty_string\" ]; then \techo \"empty string is non_empty\" fi  if [ -e \"${HOME}/.fvwmrc\" ]; then \t\t\t# test to see if ~/.fvwmrc exists \techo \"you have a .fvwmrc file\" \tif [ -L \"${HOME}/.fvwmrc\" ]; then \t\t# is it a symlink ?   \t\techo \"it's a symbolic link \telif [ -f \"${HOME}/.fvwmrc\" ]; then \t# is it a regular file ? \t\techo \"it's a regular file\" \tfi else \techo \"you have no .fvwmrc file\" fi`\r\n\r\n**Some pitfalls to be wary of**\r\n\r\nThe test command needs to be in the form \"operand1<space>operator<space>operand2\" or operator<space>operand2 , in other words you really _need_ these spaces, since the shell considers the first block containing no spaces to be either an operator (if it begins with a '-') or an operand (if it doesn't). So for example; this\r\n\r\n> `if [ 1=2 ]; then  \techo \"hello\" fi`\r\n\r\ngives exactly the \"wrong\" output (ie it echos \"hello\", since it sees an operand but no operator.)\r\n\r\nAnother potential trap comes from not protecting variables in quotes. We have already given an example as to why you _must_ wrap anything you wish to use for a `-n` test with quotes. However, there are a lot of good reasons for using quotes all the time, or almost all of the time. Failing to do this when you have variables expanded inside tests can result in _very_ wierd bugs. Here's an example: For example,\r\n\r\n> `#!/bin/bash X=\"-n\" Y=\"\" if [ $X = $Y ] ; then \techo \"X=Y\" fi`\r\n\r\nThis will give misleading output since the shell expands our expression to\r\n\r\n> `[ -n = ]`\r\n\r\nand the string \"=\" has non zero length.\r\n\r\n**A brief summary of test operators**\r\n\r\nHere's a quick list of test operators. It's by no means comprehensive, but its likely to be all you'll need to remember (if you need anything else, you can always check the bash manpage ... )\r\n\r\n|     |     |     |\r\n| --- | --- | --- |\r\n| operator | produces true if... | number of operands |\r\n| \\-n | operand non zero length | 1   |\r\n| \\-z | operand has zero length | 1   |\r\n| \\-d | there exists a directory whose name is _operand_ | 1   |\r\n| \\-f | there exists a file whose name is _operand_ | 1   |\r\n| \\-eq | the operands are integers and they are equal | 2   |\r\n| \\-neq | the opposite of -eq | 2   |\r\n| \\=  | the operands are equal (as strings) | 2   |\r\n| !=  | opposite of = | 2   |\r\n| \\-lt | _operand1_ is strictly less than _operand2_ (both operands should be integers) | 2   |\r\n| \\-gt | _operand1_ is strictly greater than _operand2_ (both operands should be integers) | 2   |\r\n| \\-ge | _operand1_ is greater than or equal to _operand2_ (both operands should be integers) | 2   |\r\n| \\-le | _operand1_ is less than or equal to _operand2_ (both operands should be integers) | 2   |\r\n\r\n**Loops**\r\n\r\nLoops are constructions that enable one to reiterate a procedure or perform the same procedure on several different items. There are the following kinds of loops available in bash\r\n\r\n*   for loops\r\n*   while loops\r\n\r\n**For loops**\r\n\r\nThe syntax for the for loops is best demonstrated by example.\r\n\r\n> `#!/bin/bash for X in red green blue do \techo $X done`\r\n\r\nTHe for loop iterates the loop over the space seperated items. Note that if some of the items have embedded spaces, you need to protect them with quotes. Here's an example:\r\n\r\n> `#!/bin/bash colour1=\"red\" colour2=\"light blue\" colour3=\"dark green\" for X in \"$colour1\" $colour2\" $colour3\" do \techo $X done`\r\n\r\nCan you guess what would happen if we left out the quotes in the for statement ? This indicates that variable names should be protected with quotes unless you are pretty sure that they do not contain any spaces.\r\n\r\n**Globbing in for loops**\r\n\r\nThe shell expands a string containing a \\* to all filenames that \"match\". A filename matches if and only if it is identical to the match string after replacing the stars \\* with arbitrary strings. For example, the character \"\\*\" by itself expands to a space seperated list of all files in the working directory (excluding those that start with a dot \".\" ) So\r\n\r\n> `echo *`\r\n\r\nlists all the files and directories in the current directory.\r\n\r\n> `echo *.jpg`\r\n\r\nlists all the jpeg files.\r\n\r\n> `echo ${HOME}/public_html/*.jpg`\r\n\r\nlists all jpeg files in your public\\_html directory.\r\n\r\nAs it happens, this turns out to be very useful for performing operations on the files in a directory, especially used in conjunction with a for loop. For example:\r\n\r\n> `#!/bin/bash for X in *.html do \t\tgrep -L '<UL>' \"$X\" done`\r\n\r\n**While Loops**\r\n\r\nWhile loops iterate \"while\" a given condition is true. An example of this:\r\n\r\n> `#!/bin/bash X=0 while [ $X -le 20 ] do \techo $X \tX=$((X+1)) done`\r\n\r\nThis raises a natural question: why doesn't bash allow the C like for loops\r\n\r\n> for (X=1,X<10; X++)\r\n\r\nAs it happens, this is discouraged for a reason: bash is an interpreted language, and a rather slow one for that matter. For this reason, heavy iteration is discouraged.\r\n\r\n**Command Substitution**\r\n\r\nCommand Substitution is a very handy feature of the bash shell. It enables you to take the output of a command and treat it as though it was written on the command line. For example, if you want to set the variable X to the output of a command, the way you do this is via command substitution.\r\n\r\nThere are two means of command substitution: brace expansion and backtick expansion.\r\n\r\nBrace expansion workls as follows: `$(_commands_)` expands to the output of _commands_ This permits nesting, so _commands_ can include brace expansions\r\n\r\nBacktick expansion expands `` `_commands_` `` to the output of _commands_\r\n\r\nAn example is given;:\r\n\r\n> ``#!/bin/bash files=\"$(ls)\" web_files=`ls public_html` echo \"$files\"      # we need the quotes to preserve embedded newlines in $files echo \"$web_files\"  # we need the quotes to preserve newlines  X=`expr 3 \\* 2 + 4` # expr evaluate arithmatic expressions. man expr for details. echo \"$X\"``\r\n\r\nThe advantage of the $() substitution method is almost self evident: it is very easy to nest. It is supported by most of the bourne shell varients (the POSIX shell or better is OK). However, the backtick substitution is slightly more readable, and is supported by even the most basic shells (any #!/bin/sh version is just fine)\r\n\r\nNote that if strings are not quote-protected in the above echo statement, new lines are replaced by spaces in the output.",

      "content": "A Home For Your Bash Scripts\r\n\r\nBash scripting has always been on my to-do list. It’s a great way to alleviate repetitive command line tasks. Plus, can help optimize your workflow. The first step in this process is being able to call scripts from anywhere. This post will cover just that.\r\nHello World\r\n\r\nBefore we can call a script we need to write one. Head to your editor of choice and create a script titled helloworld.sh with the following code.\r\n> \r\n#!/bin/bash\r\necho \"hello, $USER. I wish to list some files of yours\"\r\necho \"listing files in current directory, $PWD\"\r\nls\r\n> \r\n\r\nThe only line worth mentioning is the first  **#!/bin/bash/** This lets the shell know which interpreter to run. For a more detailed breakdown check out this [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8967902/why-do-you-need-to-put-bin-bash-at-the-beginning-of-a-script-file#8967916) post.\r\n\r\n#### Get Permission\r\n\r\nNow that we have a script we need to be able to run it. In essence, we need to make the script executable. To do this we will use chmod. In order to do this next step you’ll need to head to your terminal.\r\n\r\n> chmod +x helloworld.sh\r\n\r\nWhat this command does is allow the current user, and only the current user, executable permission. To allow anyone to use this script, you would use chmod a+x filename.\r\n\r\n#### Running A Script\r\n\r\nNow that we have an awesome script and the correct permission we are good to go! In the same folder as your script run the following command.\r\n\r\n > ./helloworld.sh\r\n\r\nCongrats! You are almost a bash scripting pro. However, if you try to go and navigate somewhere else and call this script it wont work. So how do we fix this?\r\n\r\n#### Anywhere & Everywhere\r\n\r\nThe first thing to do is create a scripts directory.\r\n\r\n > mkdir scripts\r\n\r\nNow, you’ll need to specify this path in your .bashrc or .zshrc depending on what you use.\r\n\r\n> export PATH=$PATH:~/scripts\r\n\r\nAfter this you are set! You should be able to head anywhere and call your script. In order to do so, you’ll just need to type scriptname.sh.\r\n\r\n> helloworld.sh\r\n\r\n#### More rescources\r\n\r\n[Quick Guide ](http://www.panix.com/~elflord/unix/bash-tute.html)  \r\n[GoodOverview](http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prog-Intro-HOWTO.html)\r\n",

      "content": "Customizse Micro Editor  \r\n\r\nTree view, color scheme, Markdown preview, and much more in µ Editor.  \r\n\r\nMicro is a text editor thats like an evolution of nano.I've been using it for quick edits in the Terminal, but I've decided to use it for more projects and step back from all-in-one VS Code. For this, I needed to take an afternoon to customize it, and I decided to write this on my blog because the documentation isn't very comprehensive.\r\n\r\nThe editor allows extending functionalities with plugins written in Lua, besides creating macros, it has mouse support, and has a Terminal emulator. Below are the extensions I added.\r\n\r\n**Tree View**\r\n\r\nTo activate the tree view, it's necessary to download and install the `filemanager` plugin. And here we have some issues.\r\n\r\nThe version available in the Micro's official repository is not the best option because it lacks some bug fixes, and the one in the plugin repository doesn't address them either. I found this [fork](https://github.com/jakkunight/filemanager-plugin)\r\nof the plugin that solves the bug of opening new files in tabs instead of splitting the screen. However, this version doesn't fix bugs related to file creation and renaming via command prompt (something that the official Micro version fixes). So, what I did was to merge both codes and manually install the plugin.\r\n\r\nI've placed the version I'm using in this [repository](https://github.com/claromes/filemanager-plugin).\r\n\r\nTo install, create the `filemanager` directory in `.config/micro/plug` and insert the files. Done. Type `ctrl+e` to access the command prompt and type `tree`.\r\n\r\n**Notes:**\r\n\r\n-   In line 267 of the `filemanager.lua` file, you can change the default pane size. Currently, it's set to 30.\r\n-   To keep the tree view always open when starting the editor, type in the cmd prompt - \r\n        `set filemanager.openonstart true` \r\n-   Switch between the tree and the opened file using the shortcut `ctrl+w` or the mouse.\r\n-   Switch between tabs using the shortcut `alt+ >` and `alt+ <` or the mouse.\r\n\r\n**Quoter**\r\n\r\n[This plugin](https://github.com/sparques/micro-quoter) allows you to select a portion of text and insert various characters, such as `[]`, `{}` e `()`, at the beginning and end of the selection. This is similar to a feature in VS Code that I find important to have\r\n\r\nHere's how to set it up:\r\n\r\n-   In the terminal: `micro -plugin install quoter`\r\n-   By default, it comes set to ON, to deactivate it in Micro's command prompt (accessed with `ctrl-e`), type `set quoter.enable off`.\r\n\r\n**Formatter (Prettier and YAPF)**\r\n\r\nThe `autofmt` plugin is simple, useful, and covers various languages, but it has bugs and is not up to date. In this case, since it was just one repository, I forked it and fixed the code by initially changing it to a plugin only for Prettier. And while writing this text, I made a copy of the modified code and created one specifically for YAPF (Python).\r\n\r\nThe usage and installation instructions are in the README of each formatter: [Prettier](https://github.com/claromes/micro-prettier) and [YAPF](https://github.com/claromes/micro-yapf). I haven't included them in the official Micro repository yet, but I intend to. For other languages, I use formatters, but they are specific cases, such as for PHP in WordPress. However, I didn't find it necessary to create a plugin for that use case, for now.\r\n\r\nI decided to maintain these plugins to avoid depending on the community and also separated them because I don't want to maintain formatters that I don't use.\r\n\r\n**Markdown Preview**\r\n\r\nThe Micro Editor doesn't have this functionality, but since we're in the bash environment, we can use a tool that helps visualize Markdown files.\r\n\r\nI always like to preview my READMEs before committing, and the Python library [grip](https://github.com/joeyespo/grip) helps with that. It's simple to install and use.\r\n\r\n`pip install grip`\r\n\r\n`grip -b file.md`\r\n\r\nThe `-b` option automatically opens a new tab in the browser.\r\n\r\n**Note:**\r\n\r\n-   It's possible to use it with the Terminal emulator within Micro with `term grip -b file.md`, but I prefer to use bash itself because, in my case, the log doesn't open in another tab, and the screen doesn't split. So, I split the Terminal screen, with the Markdown file on one side and the grip log on the other.\r\n\r\n**Color Scheme**\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of options available on GitHub, and after finding your favorite, just follow these steps:\r\n\r\n-   Create a directory named `colorschemes` in `.config/micro`.\r\n-   Create (or paste) a file with the name of your scheme and with the extension `.micro`.\r\n-   Configure Micro via the command prompt: `set colorscheme schemename.micro`.\r\n\r\nI tested several and ended up with Dracula (in VS Code, I use the editor's default dark theme).\r\n\r\n**Editor Config**\r\n\r\nNothing to say.\r\n\r\n`micro -plugin install editorconfig`\r\n\r\n**Default Plugins**\r\n\r\nWith Micro, some plugins come included, and I want to highlight:\r\n\r\n-   `comment`: Simply place the cursor on the line and use the shortcut `alt+/`  The line will be commented according to the language used.\r\n-   `diff`: Integrates the `diffgutter` with Git. In the command prompt: `set diffgutter true`\r\n-   `status`: Allows customization of the status line, including Git information. You can customize the left side with `statusformatl` and the right side with `statusformatr`.\r\n\r\nBelow is my `settings.json` with the configurations I use.\r\n\r\n{`\r\n  \"*.js\": {\r\n    \"tabsize\": 2\r\n  },\r\n  \"*.py\": {\r\n    \"tabsize\": 4\r\n  },\r\n  \"*.ts\": {\r\n    \"tabsize\": 2\r\n  },\r\n  \"autosu\": true,\r\n  \"colorscheme\": \"dracula\",\r\n  \"diffgutter\": true,\r\n  \"eofnewline\": true,\r\n  \"ignorecase\": false,\r\n  \"mkparents\": true,\r\n  \"pluginchannels\": [\r\n    \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/micro-editor/plugin-channel/master/channel.json\"\r\n  ],\r\n  \"pluginrepos\": [],\r\n  \"scrollbar\": true,\r\n  \"softwrap\": true,\r\n  \"statusformatr\": \"$(status.branch) | $(status.hash) | $(status.size)\",\r\n  \"tabstospaces\": true,\r\n  \"wordwrap\": true\r\n}`\r\n\r\n[Read more about the options and default plugins](https://github.com/zyedidia/micro/blob/master/runtime/help/options.md).\r\n\r\n**Conclusion\r\n\r\nMicro is a good editor, which takes some effort to customize, but for those who want a \"larger\" GNU nano, this is a great tool. It's far from perfect and can't be compared to products like VS Code. I'll continue using both editors.\r\n\r\nThis is what my Micro looks like:\r\n\r\n![Interface of my editor](https://claromes.com/images/customizing-my-micro-editor.jpg)\r\n\r\n[source:](https://claromes.com/blog/customizing-my-micro-editor) \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n![Pencil Emoji version 1.0](https://claromes.com/images/website/emoji-pencil.svg) [Claromes](https://claromes.com/pages/whoami)\r\n\r\n![Label Emoji version 1.0](https://claromes.com/images/website/emoji-label.svg) [open source](https://claromes.com/tag/open-source.html) · [english](https://claromes.com/tag/english.html) · [bash](https://claromes.com/tag/bash.html)\r\n",

      "content": "Edward V and His Kid Brother Go \"Poof !\"\r\n\r\nThe War of the Roses between the House of York and the House of Lancaster over the English throne is no doubt one of the most notorious - and deadly - family feuds in human history. The participants were so self-serving and cold-hearted that the lives of two young boys were sacrificed to serve the ambitions of the older generation.\r\n\r\nEdward V was born November 2, 1470, the elder son of Edward IV and Elizabeth Woodville. When his father, the King, died on April 9, 1483, the 12-year-old monarch departed from Ludlow Castle to make his way to London and his new life as King.\r\n\r\nHis paternal uncle Richard, Duke of Gloucester, had other ideas.\r\n\r\n![None](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:300/1*kilF2f_g5D4SZz2wWJiWDw.jpeg)\r\n\r\n*\"I didn't off those kids! Pinky swear!\"*\r\n\r\nGloucester, who was chosen as Edward's Guardian and Lord Protector by the late King, interrupted his progress while he was en route. Richard was accompanied by the Duke of Buckingham and a large group of armed men: The young King objected, but he knew he had little choice but to acquiesce.\r\n\r\nWhen word reached London of these developments, panic began to spread. Richard astutely assured the English people his only goal was to keep those social climbing Woodvilles from staging a coup. This satisfied most, as the widowed Queen's family was heartily disliked by the people of England.\r\n\r\nKing Edward was brought to the Tower of London, supposedly to await his coronation. Nothing seemed odd about this at the time, as the Tower was also a royal residence as well as a prison and place of execution.\r\n\r\nElizabeth Woodville was keeping her other son, the 10-year-old Richard, Duke of York, cooped up with her in Westminster Abbey, where she had sought sanctuary. Eventually, Gloucester managed to convince Elizabeth Woodville that she was being an overprotective drama Queen regarding Richard's safety: after all, his big brother Edward would really enjoy their company. Elizabeth finally relented, and Richard had control of both the heir and the spare.\r\n\r\n![None](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*Taov_bAO7qeojEEOXn5R1g.jpeg)\r\n\r\n*Bastards. Painting by H.E. Marshall*\r\n\r\nSoon after, Gloucester had Lord Hastings by for a visit under the ruse of discussing the upcoming coronation. Hastings, who had been very close to the old King Edward IV, would never endorse the disinheriting of his kids, and Richard knew it. In the space of a day, Hastings was arrested for treason and executed without a trial.\r\n\r\nThen the Duke of Buckingham resurrected an old claim that Edward IV was not a legitimate son of Richard, Duke of York. He also asserted that Edward IV's marriage to Elizabeth Woodville wasn't valid as he was pre-contracted to someone else, obviously believing the theory that if you fling enough B.S., something is bound to stick.\r\n\r\nBuckingham called upon The Duke of Gloucester to ascend the throne as the true heir of York and England's rightful King. Richard, of course, appeared hesitant to do so (Oh noes! I could *never* usurp the throne from my sweet little nephew!) But before you could say \"mission accomplished,\" Gloucester was proclaiming himself Richard III (get the hell outta my way ya little twerp!)\r\n\r\nThe two young princes, who had been seen playing in the gardens of the Tower, were observed less and less frequently. By the summer of 1483, they were seen no more.\r\n\r\n![None](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*Ad6cMtBPB0GiAy6DgwfvDA.jpeg)\r\n\r\n*\"Dude - is Uncle Dick even more dickish than usual lately?\"*\r\n\r\nThe accepted story for the past five centuries has been the obvious one — the boys were murdered on the order of their evil uncle Richard. The Tudor humanist scholar Thomas More certainly believed this to be the case; he relates that both the boys were smothered with pillows and buried beneath a staircase in the Tower on King Richard's orders.\r\n\r\nModern apologists for Richard say this is partisan Tudor propaganda, and Henry VII, the first Tudor monarch, could have been responsible for the princes' demise. It would certainly explain why he ordered his mother-in-law Elizabeth Woodville to a nunnery (he married the younger sister of the princes, another Elizabeth, uniting the houses of York and Lancaster.)\r\n\r\nSome speculate Henry VII did this to ensure her silence because she discovered his secret. That's possible, but most still believe it was Good ol' Uncle Richard who did the two young princes in.\r\n\r\n![None](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/0*rLY2FUoGhuxPiolS.jpeg)\r\n\r\nTags:\r\n\r\n ",

But the mute yellow bear that casts the spell?\r\n\r\nThat would be Sooty.\r\n\r\nAnd cast a spell he did. That mantra has been screamed by kids, parents, grandparents and great-grandparents at the television and in theatres for a whopping seventy five years. Collating all the variant TV formats together, Sooty is the longest-running children's programme in the world.\r\n\r\nHis success can be attributed to many things - some would say it's the characters, some would say it's the childish joy it brings to generation upon generation, but the real answer, according to current right hand man Cadell, is Sooty's simplicity. The gags he does with the gang on television now are the same ones Harry did in the 1950s, when Sooty genuinely did have soot dabbed on his ears so he would show up on black and white television (hence the name), and they still make children and adults alike shriek with laughter.\r\n\r\nSo where did it all begin?\r\n\r\n[Harry Corbett](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/harry_corbett/ \"Harry Corbett profile\") was the nephew of famous fish and chip mogul Harry Ramsden, for whom he played piano in his restaurants. Music was his chosen career path, though sadly deafness in one ear precluded him from pursuing it professionally. His day job saw him work for Leeds City Council as an engineer and he'd also honed a one hour magic act, which he performed for extra money in the evenings.\r\n\r\n![Matthew, Harry and Marjorie Corbett pictured in 1964 as Soo was first introduced.

Image shows left to right: Matthew Corbett, Harry Corbett, Marjorie Corbett*\r\n\r\nThen, on 19th July [1948](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1948/ \"A guide to the year 1948\"), the Corbett family - which, by this time, was made up of Harry's wife Marjorie and sons David and Peter, the latter of whom would change his name professionally to Matthew - while holidaying in Blackpool, happened upon a novelty shop on the North Pier. Corbett's eye was caught by a yellow bear puppet. According to a Guardian article published in [1987](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1987/ \"A guide to the year 1987\"), Corbett recalled the moment, saying \"Even now I can't tell you exactly what it was about him, but I just couldn't leave him\". He bought the bear for seven shillings and sixpence.\r\n\r\nIt would be the best investment of his life.\r\n\r\nChristening the bear Teddy, Corbett initially only used it to entertain his two sons, only later incorporating the puppet into his magic shows. Before long, the bear's antics were so popular he restructured the entire act around it.\r\n\r\nA little-known fact is that Harry and Sooty owe a huge debt of gratitude to Violet Carson, better known as hair-netted harridan Ena Sharples in _Coronation Street_. One of Harry's neighbours was Barney Colehan, then the producer of _Have A Go_, a popular radio quiz hosted by [Wilfred Pickles](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/wilfred_pickles/ \"Wilfred Pickles profile\"), with Carson playing piano. The Government wanted to send the quiz on a tour of northern coalfields to boost miners' morale, but Carson wanted nothing to do with it. Remembering his neighbour played the piano, Harry was duly booked in her place. The ensuing tour saw the teddy puppet portion of his act hugely popular with the audiences, and Harry credited those shows with teaching much of the vital stagecraft he would use for the rest of his career.\r\n\r\nRenamed Sooty, the bear made his television debut in [1952](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1952/ \"A guide to the year 1952\") on the [BBC](https://www.comedy.co.uk/pro/blackbook/companies/bbc/ \"Find out more about BBC\")'s _Talent Night_, which led to appearances on [Peter Butterworth](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/peter_butterworth/ \"Peter Butterworth profile\")'s _Saturday Special_ soon thereafter. Spotting the further potential of the puppet, the [BBC](https://www.comedy.co.uk/pro/blackbook/companies/bbc/ \"Find out more about BBC\") offered Corbett his own series, which began in [1955](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1955/ \"A guide to the year 1955\").\r\n\r\n![The Sooty Show. Harry Corbett. Credit: BBC](https://cdn.comedy.co.uk/images/library/comedies/900x450/t/the_sooty_show_1955.jpg \"The Sooty Show. Harry Corbett. Credit: BBC\")\r\n\r\nThe Sooty Show. Harry Corbett. Credit: BBC\r\n\r\nHis only real rival on children's television at the time was _Muffin The Mule_, a popular equine marionette, but because Harry was so vehement in registering all the copyrights, a range of merchandising, as well as appearing in an television advert for Oxo, meant that Sooty quickly turned into a sensation eclipsing his opposite number.\r\n\r\nThe template of [The Sooty Show](https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/the_sooty_show/ \"The Sooty Show: 1952 - 1992 BBC One sitcom. Click for a guide.\") was quickly established. Harry was the weary, browbeaten father to Sooty, a five year-old boy who happened to be a teddy bear. Each episode saw Sooty attempt to accomplish some task or other, usually ending with Sooty covering Harry in condiments, and frequently shooting him with his now iconic water pistol.\r\n\r\nSo famous was the water pistol, in fact, that when Harry and Sooty appeared at The British Industries Fair at London Olympia, it made front page news when he squirted Prince Philip (he very nearly went for [The Queen](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/gerry-connolly/ \"AKA Gerry Connolly. Click to view profile.\"), but Harry felt he shouldn't on account of her wearing velvet). Harry later recalled that Her Majesty \"howled with laughter\".\r\n\r\nHarry thought of Sooty as part of the family to the extent that he would drill air holes into Sooty's box and only lay him face up. The family once went on holiday, and upon discovering they'd left Sooty at home, Harry cried \"I can't go without him!\". He would bring Sooty to meetings, and even perform with his bare hands if Sooty wasn't with him. In fact, so important were Harry's hands that he had his thumb and two fingers insured at a premium of £150 a year.\r\n\r\nIt was around this time that Harry signed a deal to make forty short _Sooty_ films for Disney. The films were shown coast to coast in America on _Micky's Club House_ and quickly developed a cult following.\r\n\r\nWith Sooty becoming more popular, and Harry running out of magic tricks he could have him do, in [1957](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1957/ \"A guide to the year 1957\") he decided to steer the show closer towards the sitcom format we know and love today. For this, he needed a new character.\r\n\r\nEnter Sweep.\r\n\r\n![Sooty. Copyright: Tivoli Media](https://cdn.comedy.co.uk/images/library/comedies/900x450/t/the_sooty_show_2018.jpg \"Sooty. Copyright: Tivoli Media\")\r\n\r\nThe calamitous canine whose squeak can only be understood by a select few, his original puppeteer (and Harry's brother) Leslie Corbett achieved the sound through the use of a saxophone reed. The double act propelled Sooty to even greater heights, with the bickering, brotherly relationship paving the way for even more slapstick.\r\n\r\nIt was [1964](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1964/ \"A guide to the year 1964\") when the triumvirate was completed with the addition of Soo, a panda who was originally voiced and operated by Harry's wife Marjorie. It also meant that there was someone for Harry to interact with more clearly, as Sooty couldn't talk and Sweep only squeaked. Other characters were also introduced, like Ramsbottom, a snake who spoke in a rich Yorkshire dialect; Butch, a fearsome bulldog; and the little remembered Kipper the Cat.\r\n\r\nThe final episode of [The Sooty Show](https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/the_sooty_show/ \"The Sooty Show: 1952 - 1992 BBC One sitcom. Click for a guide.\") to air on the [BBC](https://www.comedy.co.uk/pro/blackbook/companies/bbc/ \"Find out more about BBC\") was a Christmas special in [1967](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1967/ \"A guide to the year 1967\"), after which the unthinkable happened - the [BBC](https://www.comedy.co.uk/pro/blackbook/companies/bbc/ \"Find out more about BBC\") cancelled Sooty, reportedly after a creative disagreement over the series' ongoing format. Luckily, [Thames Television](https://www.comedy.co.uk/pro/blackbook/companies/thames_television/ \"Find out more about Thames Television\") were ready to swoop in and save the day, so the Corbetts made the move to ITV, where the series still resides today.\r\n\r\n[1973](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1973/ \"A guide to the year 1973\") saw Harry and Sooty join the ranks of showbiz royalty by appearing as guests on [The Morecambe And Wise Show](https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/the_morecambe_and_wise_show/ \"The Morecambe And Wise Show: 1961 - 1968 ITV1 sketch show with Morecambe & Wise. Click for a guide.\") (Series 7, Episode 11). The sketch saw the pair attempt to perform [The Sooty Show](https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/the_sooty_show/ \"The Sooty Show: 1952 - 1992 BBC One sitcom. Click for a guide.\"), complete with Eric in a life-size Sooty costume.\r\n\r\n![Loading video](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WFdVNekfjSc/hqdefault.jpg)<iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WFdVNekfjSc?enablejsapi=1&amp;amp=1&amp;rel=0&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;fs=1&amp;iv_load_policy=3&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;wmode=transparent&amp;playsinline=1\" class=\"i-amphtml-fill-content\" title=\"YouTube video\" allow=\"autoplay;\"></iframe>\r\n\r\nAs well as appearing as the Prime Minister and Home Secretary in a special episode of [The Goodies](https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/the_goodies/ \"The Goodies: 1970 - 1982 BBC Two sitcom about three men. Click for a guide.\") entitled _The Goodies Rule - O.K?_, [1975](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1975/ \"A guide to the year 1975\") was a landmark year for Sooty, and not for the nicest of reasons. On Christmas Day, Harry suffered a huge heart attack that would put him out of action for the next year. Matthew, by this point establishing a career as a children's entertainer in his own right by appearing as a presenter on _Rainbow_, was entrusted to take over presenting the following Christmas special.\r\n\r\nHowever, it was not all plain sailing behind the scenes. Matthew would eventually buy the rights from his father (to the tune of a reported £35,000) under the condition that he stop performing with Sooty completely, in order to enable Matthew to establish himself as Sooty's new right-hand man. However, Harry continued to tour, culminating with father and son appearing on the same night in rival theatres in the East of England, Harry realised it was finally time to wind things down. He continued to make guest appearances _alongside_ Matthew in the show and he performed on stage right up to the very end - his final performance was at the Pavilion Theatre in Weymouth on 15th August [1989](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1989/ \"A guide to the year 1989\"). He died two days later.\r\n\r\n![Image shows left to right: Harry Corbett, Matthew Corbett](https://cdn.comedy.co.uk/images/library/misc/900x450/s/sooty_harry_matthew_corbett.jpg \"Image shows left to right: Harry Corbett, Matthew Corbett\")\r\n\r\n*Image shows left to right: Harry Corbett, Matthew Corbett*\r\n\r\nIt wasn't until the [1980](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1980/ \"A guide to the year 1980\") Christmas special that Matthew established the formula that would ensure the show ran under his stewardship until [1998](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1998/ \"A guide to the year 1998\"). He dispensed with all extra elements, and moved the characters into a house, complete with their own bedroom. This setup enabled the show to morph into a fully-fledged sitcom, with the gang embarking on some kind of adventure each week. [1981](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1981/ \"A guide to the year 1981\") was the year that [Brenda Longman](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/brenda_longman/ \"Brenda Longman profile\") took over the voice of Soo, a role she still perfoms to this day, also appearing as Mo in [Sooty & Co.](https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/sooty_co/ \"Sooty & Co.: 1993 - 1998 ITV1 sitcom. Click for a guide.\"), Dotty in [Sooty Heights](https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/sooty-heights/ \"Sooty Heights: 1999 - 2004 ITV1 sitcom. Click for a guide.\") and in various episodes of the current [Sooty](https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/sooty/ \"Sooty: 2011 - 2018 ITVBe sitcom about a group of puppets. Click for a guide.\") show.\r\n\r\nOne memorable episode during the [Matthew Corbett](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/matthew_corbett/ \"Matthew Corbett profile\") era is _Sweep's Family_, which saw Sweep's brothers and cousins, including Swoop, Swap and Swipe, come to stay; the ensuing mayhem of a seemingly uncountable number of squeaking grey dogs really has to be seen to be believed.\r\n\r\nFourteen years before he took over Matthew's role, a teenage [Richard Cadell](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/richard_cadell/ \"Richard Cadell profile\") guest starred in the [1985](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1985/ \"A guide to the year 1985\") Christmas Special as a magician. In fact, this episode is a perfect example of the magic of Sooty: it saw Matthew and Sooty perform for children in hospital. As a viewer, witnessing the power of that little yellow bear as he instantly cheers up patients, nurses, parents, and everyone else who crosses his path, is absolutely delightful.\r\n\r\n![Sooty. Richard (Richard Cadell)](https://cdn.comedy.co.uk/images/library/comedies/900x450/s/sooty_happy_birthday.jpg \"Sooty. Richard (Richard Cadell)\")\r\n\r\n*Sooty. Richard (Richard Cadell)*\r\n\r\n[1987](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1987/ \"A guide to the year 1987\") saw [Brian Sandford](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/brian_sandford/ \"Brian Sandford profile\") join the team to play Sweep, and like Longman he not only still plays him to this day but also appears in various supporting roles in the television series.\r\n\r\nIt's perhaps no surprise that Sooty has seen his fair share of famous fans and guest stars over the years. Matthew claimed in Geoff Tibballs' wonderful book _The Secret Life Of Sooty_ that he is particularly proud of making [Spike Milligan](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/spike_milligan/ \"Spike Milligan profile\") laugh with his script for _Sootograms_, a [1986](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1986/ \"A guide to the year 1986\") episode that saw [The Goons](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/all_genres/all_channels/0/The+Goons/ \"Click for a list of guides that match The Goons.\") star partake in some classic Sooty slapstick. The foreword to the aforementioned book was written by unlikely Sooty superfan [George Harrison](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/george_harrison/ \"George Harrison profile\") - who explained that he once had to ask Matthew for his autograph because [Ringo Starr](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/ringo_starr/ \"Ringo Starr profile\") was a huge fan!\r\n\r\nIron Maiden drummer Nicko McBrain participated in a drum-off with Sooty in [1988](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1988/ \"A guide to the year 1988\") episode _Hidden Talent_; to this day McBrain keeps a Sooty puppet on his drums during concerts. In the same year, [Carry On](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/group/carry_on/ \"Click to find out more about Carry On.\") stalwart [Bernard Bresslaw](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/bernard_bresslaw/ \"Bernard Bresslaw profile\") appeared _Sooty's Magic Lamp_.\r\n\r\n[1988](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1988/ \"A guide to the year 1988\") was also the year that childhood icons collided, when Sooty himself became a guest star, appearing in _Hobbies_, an episode in the second series of [ChuckleVision](https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/chucklevision/ \"ChuckleVision: 1987 - 2009 BBC One sitcom about mishap-prone brothers. Click for a guide.\"). Bringing things full circle, [Richard Cadell](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/richard_cadell/ \"Richard Cadell profile\") toured with The Chuckle Brothers in the 1990s, again performing his magic act.\r\n\r\nNot only did Matthew write and star in the television show during this period, but he also penned a number of Sooty stage plays, further boosting the bear's popularity. These included _Sooty's Creepy Castle_, _Sooty's Picnic_ and _Sooty In Space_. Corbett co-starred in the shows with Connie Creighton, a frequent guest star in the television series. For the latter half of each year, while Matthew was busy writing and recording the television series, Creighton would co-present the live show with Spencer K. Gibbens. Cadell continues the trend of mixing both live and broadcast outings, with a special 75th anniversary stage tour planned for later this year.\r\n\r\nIn [1990](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1990/ \"A guide to the year 1990\") Matthew added another series regular in the form of Little Cousin Scampi, who quickly became a fan favourite.\r\n\r\nRevamping the series in [1992](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1992/ \"A guide to the year 1992\"), [Sooty & Co.](https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/sooty_co/ \"Sooty & Co.: 1993 - 1998 ITV1 sitcom. Click for a guide.\") saw Corbett and the gang running a shop. Guest stars in this iteration included a very young [Paul Zerdin](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/paul_zerdin/ \"Paul Zerdin profile\") (_Tidy Box_), [Jack Dee](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/jack_dee/ \"Jack Dee profile\") (_Stars In Their Eyes_), [Harry Hill](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/harry_hill/ \"Harry Hill profile\") (_Estate Agents_) and [Paul Merton](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/paul_merton/ \"Paul Merton profile\") (_Buy Buy Everybody_). Merton's appearance was later used in a round on [Have I Got News For You](https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/hignfy/ \"Have I Got News For You: 1990 - 2024 BBC One panel show about the news. Click for a guide.\"), a clip of which can be seen on [The Paul Merton Collection](https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/room_101/shop/766/the_paul_merton_collection_dvd/ \"More details about this product\") DVD.\r\n\r\nMatthew even got into trouble for one particular script called _Soo's Babies_, which had Soo pretend to be pregnant by stuffing a pillow up her dress. It received complaints from viewers and ended up being reported in the national press.\r\n\r\nSooty Heights\r\n\r\n![Sooty Heights](https://cdn.comedy.co.uk/images/library/comedies/900x450/s/sooty_heights.jpg \"Sooty Heights\")\r\n\r\nIn [1996](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1996/ \"A guide to the year 1996\"), Sooty joined the likes of [Victoria Wood](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/victoria_wood/ \"Victoria Wood profile\"), [Billy Connolly](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/billy_connolly/ \"Billy Connolly profile\") and [Ken Dodd](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/ken_dodd/ \"Ken Dodd profile\") when [ITV](https://www.comedy.co.uk/pro/blackbook/companies/itv/ \"Find out more about ITV\") aired the entertainment special _An Audience With Sooty_, which saw Matthew and the gang entertain a celebrity audience and their children. It is one of only two home video releases of Matthew and Sooty live on stage, and it's a wonderful example of just how brilliant a comic performer Matthew was, committing so fully to everything from slapstick sequences like Sooty slapping him in the face and then refusing to go to sleep, to delivering jokes that both the children and their parents in the audience can enjoy, it is an absolute masterclass in comedy.\r\n\r\nThe following year, Sooty and Matthew made a rare appearance on an adult-orientated show, when they appeared as panellists on the [1997](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1997/ \"A guide to the year 1997\") Christmas special of [They Think It's All Over](https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/they_think_its_all_over/ \"They Think It's All Over: 1995 - 2006 BBC One panel show loosely themed around sport. Click for a guide.\"). Their only other notable appearance outside the realms of children's entertainment was an episode of [Bobby Davro](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/bobby_davro/ \"Bobby Davro profile\")'s sketch show in [1989](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1989/ \"A guide to the year 1989\") called _Sooty In Soho_, with Davro impersonating Matthew, before the real Matthew and Sooty appear at the end to put a stop to it.\r\n\r\nHaving conquered stage and screen, one of the more bizarre offshoots was _Sooty's Amazing Adventures_, an animated series which ran from [1997](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1997/ \"A guide to the year 1997\") until [1998](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1998/ \"A guide to the year 1998\"). Although Sooty remained steadfastly silent, Sweep talked, with the voice of [Rob Rackstraw](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/rob_rackstraw/ \"Rob Rackstraw profile\"), Soo was now voiced by [Susie Blake](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/susie_blake/ \"Susie Blake profile\") and Little Cousin Scampi was voiced by [Jimmy Hibbert](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/jimmy_hibbert/ \"Jimmy Hibbert profile\"). No longer confined to puppetry, the characters walk around, fall through a time portal and go on adventures.\r\n\r\nYes, really.\r\n\r\n[Richard Cadell](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/richard_cadell/ \"Richard Cadell profile\"), along with Liana Bridges, appeared as regulars in the final series of [Sooty & Co.](https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/sooty_co/ \"Sooty & Co.: 1993 - 1998 ITV1 sitcom. Click for a guide.\") in [1998](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1998/ \"A guide to the year 1998\") to prepare viewers for the changing of hands, so to speak, and Matthew officially retired. The following year, Cadell and Bridges presented [Sooty Heights](https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/sooty-heights/ \"Sooty Heights: 1999 - 2004 ITV1 sitcom. Click for a guide.\"), which saw the gang run a seaside hotel.\r\n\r\nThe programme firmly established Cadell as Sooty's new right hand man, frequently incorporating magic tricks, and saw even more guest stars appear - including [Robin Parkinson](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/robin_parkinson/ \"Robin Parkinson profile\") and [Marcia Warren](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/marcia_warren/ \"Marcia Warren profile\") (_Friends And Romans_), [Matthew Kelly](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/matthew_kelly/ \"Matthew Kelly profile\") (_To Share Is To Care_) and [Brian Blessed](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/brian_blessed/ \"Brian Blessed profile\"), the latter of whom is the only person to have guest starred on [Sooty & Co.](https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/sooty_co/ \"Sooty & Co.: 1993 - 1998 ITV1 sitcom. Click for a guide.\"), [Sooty Heights](https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/sooty-heights/ \"Sooty Heights: 1999 - 2004 ITV1 sitcom. Click for a guide.\") and [Sooty](https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/sooty/ \"Sooty: 2011 - 2018 ITVBe sitcom about a group of puppets. Click for a guide.\") (_1997 Christmas Special_, _You Must Be Joking_ and _Pranks and Presents_).\r\n\r\nIn [2001](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/2001/ \"A guide to the year 2001\"), the show was refreshed and retitled [Sooty](https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/sooty/ \"Sooty: 2011 - 2018 ITVBe sitcom about a group of puppets. Click for a guide.\"), with Vicki Lee Taylor appearing alongside Cadell. However, the quality of the scripts was going downhill, and Cadell has stated in interviews that he felt the series was losing sight of the magic formula that made Sooty a success in the first place. It came to an end in [2004](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/2004/ \"A guide to the year 2004\"), going on an indefinite hiatus.\r\n\r\n![Sooty. Richard (Richard Cadell)](https://cdn.comedy.co.uk/images/library/comedies/900x450/s/sooty_group.jpg \"Sooty. Richard (Richard Cadell)\")\r\n\r\n*Sooty. Richard (Richard Cadell)*\r\n\r\n[2008](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/2008/ \"A guide to the year 2008\") saw the rights to Sooty put up for sale, and Cadell snapped them up. He set about returning the show to television, first by making a straight-to-DVD special, _Sooty's Big Day Out_ ([2009](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/2009/ \"A guide to the year 2009\")), before a new iteration of [Sooty](https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/sooty/ \"Sooty: 2011 - 2018 ITVBe sitcom about a group of puppets. Click for a guide.\") hit [CITV](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/channel/citv/ \"More details about CITV\") in [2011](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/2011/ \"A guide to the year 2011\").\r\n\r\nCo-writer [Wink Taylor](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/wink_taylor/ \"Wink Taylor profile\") explained that, when scripting the series: \"All the writers are very much encouraged to look back on the past episodes for inspiration. I consider [Harry Corbett](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/harry_corbett/ \"Harry Corbett profile\") to be the master and I was lucky enough to meet him as a child. It was like meeting the Wizard of Oz - he was magical! I remember one episode where Sooty built a space rocket and I asked Richard if I could modernise the story. I was thrilled when the writing was credited to [Harry Corbett](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/harry_corbett/ \"Harry Corbett profile\") and [Wink Taylor](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/wink_taylor/ \"Wink Taylor profile\"). To be credited alongside a giant of children's entertainment was a dream come true.\"\r\n\r\nThis latest incarnation of [Sooty](https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/sooty/ \"Sooty: 2011 - 2018 ITVBe sitcom about a group of puppets. Click for a guide.\") re-established the classic formula, quickly propelling the beloved yellow bear to the apex of children's television once more. He even made headlines in [2011](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/2011/ \"A guide to the year 2011\") when [Paul Daniels](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/paul_daniels/ \"Paul Daniels profile\") was hospitalised due to an injury sustained when Sooty threw a pizza at his head!\r\n\r\nSo, what's next for Sooty? In [2022](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/2022/ \"A guide to the year 2022\") Cadell launched _Sooty Land_, a new area at Crealy Theme Park in Exeter, which features rides, attractions and a Hall Of Fame museum, chock full of Sooty goodies and memorabilia. For quite some time there has also been talk of a Sooty feature film: Cadell has explained in interviews that it is stuck in development but he hopes to get it off the ground eventually. With a new series and a tour coming up, it seems that 75 years is just the start for Sooty.\r\n\r\nThere's only one thing left to say:\r\n\r\nBye bye, everybody. Bye bye!\r\n\r\n\r\nTags:\r\n  1950s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, articles, TV, sooty, harry_corbett, mathew_corbett, 80s_TV,",

For this use case wget comes with a bunch options to access a website and by following all the internal links download the entire site to a local, browsable copy.\r\n\r\nThe full set of options that we will use are as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nwget \\\r\n  --mirror \\\r\n  --page-requisites \\\r\n  --html-extension \\\r\n  --convert-links \\\r\n  <SITE-ADDRESS>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll you need to do is to replace with the web address of the website (without HTTP/HTTPS) that you use to access the site e.g. www.example.com.\r\n\r\nThis command will mirror the target website into a directory under the one you are in with the name of the domain name.\r\n\r\nThis page on https://explainshell.com will explain all the options I used.\r\n",

For this you can edit the /*etc/X11/Xsession* configuration file of the X Window system and locate the following line:\r\n\r\n\r\n![xsession config](https://i.imgur.com/RStYMEZ.jpeg)\r\n\r\n```\r\nERRFILE=$HOME/.xsession-errors\r\n```\r\n\r\nReplace it with:\r\n\r\n```\r\nERRFILE=/dev/null\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also delete the .xsession-errors file and create a symbolic link to */dev/null* instead in order to get the same result:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ rm .xsession-errors\r\n$ ln -s /dev/null .xsession-errors\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem is that when you restart the session the symbolic link will be replaced back by a regular file and will start to grow again.

Edit the CSS File\r\n\r\n1. Open or create the file:\r\n\r\n   Path:  \r\n   `/home/user/.config/gtk-3.0`\r\n\r\n2. Add the *following* CSS code. Feel free to modify the sizes; remember to use the !important flag to override existing styles.\r\n\r\n```css\r\n#docklike-plugin .menu {\r\n  min-width: 300px !important;  /* Set minimum menu width */\r\n  min-height: 200px !important; /* Set minimum menu height */\r\n}\r\n\r\n#docklike-plugin .window_preview {\r\n  min-width: 280px !important;  /* Preview image constraints */\r\n  min-height: 180px !important;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Save your changes.\r\n\r\n4. To see the changes, refresh the panel by restarting it:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nxfce4-panel -r\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Step 2. Adjust previewScale for Proportional Scaling\r\n\r\n1. The default baseline for optimal results is `previewScale=0.25`.  \r\n   To set this, locate the configuration file, typically found at:\r\n\r\n   ```\r\n   ~/.config/xfce4/panel/docklike-#.rc\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n   (Replace `#` with the appropriate docklike instance number.)\r\n\r\n2. Open the configuration file in your preferred text editor.\r\n\r\n3. Look for the preview scale setting and modify or add the following line:\r\n\r\n```ini\r\npreviewScale=0.25\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Save the file and restart the panel:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nxfce4-panel -r\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Step 3. Setting CSS Dimensions Proportional to previewScale\r\n\r\nWhen using **previewScale=0.25**, ensure your CSS dimensions are set to about 120% of the scaled preview dimensions. For example, if your desired scaled preview dimensions are given by a base size (e.g., 230px width when scaled), your CSS should be adjusted accordingly:\r\n\r\n- Calculate 120% of the scaled value:\r\n  \r\n  For width: desired CSS width = 230px * 1.2\r\n\r\n- Update your CSS accordingly.\r\n\r\n#### Known Limitations\r\n\r\n- **v0.4.3 Limitation:** There is no native maximum size constraint.  \r\n- **CSS Constraint Issues:** Certain CSS dimension properties might not be fully honored by preview windows.  \r\n- **Text Truncation:** If text in menus is truncated, the solution currently involves changing the source code.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Future Considerations\r\n\r\nThe development team is considering label width customization in upcoming versions. For now, the combination of CSS tweaks and `previewScale` settings provides the most control over the preview sizing.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFollowing these steps should give you improved control over the preview sizes and menu dimensions in your xfce4-docklike-plugin, making navigation more consistent and visually coherent. Feel free to experiment with the dimensions until you find the desired look and functionality.",

      "content": "Using \"fd\" Fast And Friendly Alternative To 'find' \r\n\r\n`fd` is a program to find entries in your filesystem.\r\nIt is a simple, fast and user-friendly alternative to [`find`](https://www.gnu.org/software/findutils/).\r\nWhile it does not aim to support all of `find`'s powerful functionality, it provides sensible\r\n(opinionated) defaults for a majority of use cases.\r\n\r\n[Installation](#installation) • [How to use](#how-to-use) • [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\n* Intuitive syntax: `fd PATTERN` instead of `find -iname '*PATTERN*'`.\r\n* Regular expression (default) and glob-based patterns.\r\n* [Very fast](#benchmark) due to parallelized directory traversal.\r\n* Uses colors to highlight different file types (same as `ls`).\r\n* Supports [parallel command execution](#command-execution)\r\n* Smart case: the search is case-insensitive by default. It switches to\r\n  case-sensitive if the pattern contains an uppercase\r\n  character[\\*](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/options.html#'smartcase').\r\n* Ignores hidden directories and files, by default.\r\n* Ignores patterns from your `.gitignore`, by default.\r\n* The command name is *50%* shorter[\\*](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) than\r\n  `find` :-).\r\n\r\n### Demo\r\n\r\n![Demo](doc/screencast.svg)\r\n\r\n### How to use\r\n\r\nFirst, to get an overview of all available command line options, you can either run\r\n[`fd -h`](#command-line-options) for a concise help message or `fd --help` for a more detailed\r\nversion.\r\n\r\n### Simple search\r\n\r\n*fd* is designed to find entries in your filesystem. The most basic search you can perform is to\r\nrun *fd* with a single argument: the search pattern. For example, assume that you want to find an\r\nold script of yours (the name included `netflix`):\r\n``` bash\r\n> fd netfl\r\nSoftware/python/imdb-ratings/netflix-details.py\r\n```\r\nIf called with just a single argument like this, *fd* searches the current directory recursively\r\nfor any entries that *contain* the pattern `netfl`.\r\n\r\n### Regular expression search\r\n\r\nThe search pattern is treated as a regular expression. Here, we search for entries that start\r\nwith `x` and end with `rc`:\r\n``` bash\r\n> cd /etc\r\n> fd '^x.*rc$'\r\nX11/xinit/xinitrc\r\nX11/xinit/xserverrc\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe regular expression syntax used by `fd` is [documented here](https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/#syntax).\r\n\r\n### Specifying the root directory\r\n\r\nIf we want to search a specific directory, it can be given as a second argument to *fd*:\r\n``` bash\r\n> fd passwd /etc\r\n/etc/default/passwd\r\n/etc/pam.d/passwd\r\n/etc/passwd\r\n```\r\n\r\n### List all files, recursively\r\n\r\n*fd* can be called with no arguments. This is very useful to get a quick overview of all entries\r\nin the current directory, recursively (similar to `ls -R`):\r\n``` bash\r\n> cd fd/tests\r\n> fd\r\ntestenv\r\ntestenv/mod.rs\r\ntests.rs\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you want to use this functionality to list all files in a given directory, you have to use\r\na catch-all pattern such as `.` or `^`:\r\n``` bash\r\n> fd . fd/tests/\r\ntestenv\r\ntestenv/mod.rs\r\ntests.rs\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Searching for a particular file extension\r\n\r\nOften, we are interested in all files of a particular type. This can be done with the `-e` (or\r\n`--extension`) option. Here, we search for all Markdown files in the fd repository:\r\n``` bash\r\n> cd fd\r\n> fd -e md\r\nCONTRIBUTING.md\r\nREADME.md\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `-e` option can be used in combination with a search pattern:\r\n``` bash\r\n> fd -e rs mod\r\nsrc/fshelper/mod.rs\r\nsrc/lscolors/mod.rs\r\ntests/testenv/mod.rs\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Searching for a particular file name\r\n\r\n To find files with exactly the provided search pattern, use the `-g` (or `--glob`) option:\r\n``` bash\r\n> fd -g libc.so /usr\r\n/usr/lib32/libc.so\r\n/usr/lib/libc.so\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Hidden and ignored files\r\nBy default, *fd* does not search hidden directories and does not show hidden files in the\r\nsearch results. To disable this behavior, we can use the `-H` (or `--hidden`) option:\r\n``` bash\r\n> fd pre-commit\r\n> fd -H pre-commit\r\n.git/hooks/pre-commit.sample\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we work in a directory that is a Git repository (or includes Git repositories), *fd* does not\r\nsearch folders (and does not show files) that match one of the `.gitignore` patterns. To disable\r\nthis behavior, we can use the `-I` (or `--no-ignore`) option:\r\n``` bash\r\n> fd num_cpu\r\n> fd -I num_cpu\r\ntarget/debug/deps/libnum_cpus-f5ce7ef99006aa05.rlib\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo really search *all* files and directories, simply combine the hidden and ignore features to show\r\neverything (`-HI`) or use `-u`/`--unrestricted`.\r\n\r\n### Matching the full path\r\nBy default, *fd* only matches the filename of each file. However, using the `--full-path` or `-p` option,\r\nyou can match against the full path.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n> fd -p -g '**/.git/config'\r\n> fd -p '.*/lesson-\\d+/[a-z]+.(jpg|png)'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Command execution\r\n\r\nInstead of just showing the search results, you often want to *do something* with them. `fd`\r\nprovides two ways to execute external commands for each of your search results:\r\n\r\n* The `-x`/`--exec` option runs an external command *for each of the search results* (in parallel).\r\n* The `-X`/`--exec-batch` option launches the external command once, with *all search results as arguments*.\r\n\r\n#### Examples\r\n\r\nRecursively find all zip archives and unpack them:\r\n``` bash\r\nfd -e zip -x unzip\r\n```\r\nIf there are two such files, `file1.zip` and `backup/file2.zip`, this would execute\r\n`unzip file1.zip` and `unzip backup/file2.zip`. The two `unzip` processes run in parallel\r\n(if the files are found fast enough).\r\n\r\nFind all `*.h` and `*.cpp` files and auto-format them inplace with `clang-format -i`:\r\n``` bash\r\nfd -e h -e cpp -x clang-format -i\r\n```\r\nNote how the `-i` option to `clang-format` can be passed as a separate argument. This is why\r\nwe put the `-x` option last.\r\n\r\nFind all `test_*.py` files and open them in your favorite editor:\r\n``` bash\r\nfd -g 'test_*.py' -X vim\r\n```\r\nNote that we use capital `-X` here to open a single `vim` instance. If there are two such files,\r\n`test_basic.py` and `lib/test_advanced.py`, this will run `vim test_basic.py lib/test_advanced.py`.\r\n\r\nTo see details like file permissions, owners, file sizes etc., you can tell `fd` to show them\r\nby running `ls` for each result:\r\n``` bash\r\nfd … -X ls -lhd --color=always\r\n```\r\nThis pattern is so useful that `fd` provides a shortcut. You can use the `-l`/`--list-details`\r\noption to execute `ls` in this way: `fd … -l`.\r\n\r\nThe `-X` option is also useful when combining `fd` with [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/) (`rg`) in order to search within a certain class of files, like all C++ source files:\r\n```bash\r\nfd -e cpp -e cxx -e h -e hpp -X rg 'std::cout'\r\n```\r\n\r\nConvert all `*.jpg` files to `*.png` files:\r\n``` bash\r\nfd -e jpg -x convert {} {.}.png\r\n```\r\nHere, `{}` is a placeholder for the search result. `{.}` is the same, without the file extension.\r\nSee below for more details on the placeholder syntax.\r\n\r\nThe terminal output of commands run from parallel threads using `-x` will not be interlaced or garbled,\r\nso `fd -x` can be used to rudimentarily parallelize a task run over many files.\r\nAn example of this is calculating the checksum of each individual file within a directory.\r\n```\r\nfd -tf -x md5sum > file_checksums.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Placeholder syntax\r\n\r\nThe `-x` and `-X` options take a *command template* as a series of arguments (instead of a single string).\r\nIf you want to add additional options to `fd` after the command template, you can terminate it with a `\\;`.\r\n\r\nThe syntax for generating commands is similar to that of [GNU Parallel](https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/):\r\n\r\n- `{}`: A placeholder token that will be replaced with the path of the search result\r\n  (`documents/images/party.jpg`).\r\n- `{.}`: Like `{}`, but without the file extension (`documents/images/party`).\r\n- `{/}`: A placeholder that will be replaced by the basename of the search result (`party.jpg`).\r\n- `{//}`: The parent of the discovered path (`documents/images`).\r\n- `{/.}`: The basename, with the extension removed (`party`).\r\n\r\nIf you do not include a placeholder, *fd* automatically adds a `{}` at the end.\r\n\r\n#### Parallel vs. serial execution\r\n\r\nFor `-x`/`--exec`, you can control the number of parallel jobs by using the `-j`/`--threads` option.\r\nUse `--threads=1` for serial execution.\r\n\r\n### Excluding specific files or directories\r\n\r\nSometimes we want to ignore search results from a specific subdirectory. For example, we might\r\nwant to search all hidden files and directories (`-H`) but exclude all matches from `.git`\r\ndirectories. We can use the `-E` (or `--exclude`) option for this. It takes an arbitrary glob\r\npattern as an argument:\r\n``` bash\r\n> fd -H -E .git …\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can also use this to skip mounted directories:\r\n``` bash\r\n> fd -E /mnt/external-drive …\r\n```\r\n\r\n.. or to skip certain file types:\r\n``` bash\r\n> fd -E '*.bak' …\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo make exclude-patterns like these permanent, you can create a `.fdignore` file. They work like\r\n`.gitignore` files, but are specific to `fd`. For example:\r\n``` bash\r\n> cat ~/.fdignore\r\n/mnt/external-drive\r\n*.bak\r\n```\r\n\r\n> [!NOTE]\r\n> `fd` also supports `.ignore` files that are used by other programs such as `rg` or `ag`.\r\n\r\nIf you want `fd` to ignore these patterns globally, you can put them in `fd`'s global ignore file.\r\nThis is usually located in `~/.config/fd/ignore` in macOS or Linux, and `%APPDATA%\\fd\\ignore` in\r\nWindows.\r\n\r\nYou may wish to include `.git/` in your `fd/ignore` file so that `.git` directories, and their contents\r\nare not included in output if you use the `--hidden` option.\r\n\r\n### Deleting files\r\n\r\nYou can use `fd` to remove all files and directories that are matched by your search pattern.\r\nIf you only want to remove files, you can use the `--exec-batch`/`-X` option to call `rm`. For\r\nexample, to recursively remove all `.DS_Store` files, run:\r\n``` bash\r\n> fd -H '^\\.DS_Store$' -tf -X rm\r\n```\r\nIf you are unsure, always call `fd` without `-X rm` first. Alternatively, use `rm`s \"interactive\"\r\noption:\r\n``` bash\r\n> fd -H '^\\.DS_Store$' -tf -X rm -i\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you also want to remove a certain class of directories, you can use the same technique. You will\r\nhave to use `rm`s `--recursive`/`-r` flag to remove directories.\r\n\r\n> [!NOTE]\r\n> There are scenarios where using `fd … -X rm -r` can cause race conditions: if you have a\r\npath like `…/foo/bar/foo/…` and want to remove all directories named `foo`, you can end up in a\r\nsituation where the outer `foo` directory is removed first, leading to (harmless) *\"'foo/bar/foo':\r\nNo such file or directory\"* errors in the `rm` call.\r\n\r\n### Command-line options\r\n\r\nThis is the output of `fd -h`. To see the full set of command-line options, use `fd --help` which\r\nalso includes a much more detailed help text.\r\n\r\n```\r\nUsage: fd [OPTIONS] [pattern] [path]...\r\n\r\nArguments:\r\n  [pattern]  the search pattern (a regular expression, unless '--glob' is used; optional)\r\n  [path]...  the root directories for the filesystem search (optional)\r\n\r\nOptions:\r\n  -H, --hidden                     Search hidden files and directories\r\n  -I, --no-ignore                  Do not respect .(git|fd)ignore files\r\n  -s, --case-sensitive             Case-sensitive search (default: smart case)\r\n  -i, --ignore-case                Case-insensitive search (default: smart case)\r\n  -g, --glob                       Glob-based search (default: regular expression)\r\n  -a, --absolute-path              Show absolute instead of relative paths\r\n  -l, --list-details               Use a long listing format with file metadata\r\n  -L, --follow                     Follow symbolic links\r\n  -p, --full-path                  Search full abs. path (default: filename only)\r\n  -d, --max-depth <depth>          Set maximum search depth (default: none)\r\n  -E, --exclude <pattern>          Exclude entries that match the given glob pattern\r\n  -t, --type <filetype>            Filter by type: file (f), directory (d/dir), symlink (l),\r\n                                   executable (x), empty (e), socket (s), pipe (p), char-device\r\n                                   (c), block-device (b)\r\n  -e, --extension <ext>            Filter by file extension\r\n  -S, --size <size>                Limit results based on the size of files\r\n      --changed-within <date|dur>  Filter by file modification time (newer than)\r\n      --changed-before <date|dur>  Filter by file modification time (older than)\r\n  -o, --owner <user:group>         Filter by owning user and/or group\r\n      --format <fmt>               Print results according to template\r\n  -x, --exec <cmd>...

It contains ~750.000\r\nsubdirectories and about a 4 million files. For averaging and statistical analysis, I'm using\r\n[hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine). The following benchmarks are performed\r\nwith a \"warm\"/pre-filled disk-cache (results for a \"cold\" disk-cache show the same trends).\r\n\r\nLet's start with `find`:\r\n```\r\nBenchmark 1: find ~ -iregex '.*[0-9]\\.jpg$'\r\n  Time (mean ± σ):     19.922 s ±  0.109 s\r\n  Range (min … max):   19.765 s … 20.065 s\r\n```\r\n\r\n`find` is much faster if it does not need to perform a regular-expression search:\r\n```\r\nBenchmark 2: find ~ -iname '*[0-9].jpg'\r\n  Time (mean ± σ):     11.226 s ±  0.104 s\r\n  Range (min … max):   11.119 s … 11.466 s\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow let's try the same for `fd`. Note that `fd` performs a regular expression\r\nsearch by default. The options `-u`/`--unrestricted` option is needed here for\r\na fair comparison. Otherwise `fd` does not have to traverse hidden folders and\r\nignored paths (see below):\r\n```\r\nBenchmark 3: fd -u '[0-9]\\.jpg$' ~\r\n  Time (mean ± σ):     854.8 ms ±  10.0 ms\r\n  Range (min … max):   839.2 ms … 868.9 ms\r\n```\r\nFor this particular example, `fd` is approximately **23 times faster** than `find -iregex`\r\nand about **13 times faster** than `find -iname`. By the way, both tools found the exact\r\nsame 546 files :smile:.\r\n\r\n**Note**: This is *one particular* benchmark on *one particular* machine. While we have\r\nperformed a lot of different tests (and found consistent results), things might\r\nbe different for you! We encourage everyone to try it out on their own. See\r\n[this repository](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd-benchmarks) for all necessary scripts.\r\n\r\nConcerning *fd*'s speed, a lot of credit goes to the `regex` and `ignore` crates that are\r\nalso used in [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) (check it out!).\r\n\r\n## Troubleshooting\r\n\r\n### `fd` does not find my file!\r\n\r\nRemember that `fd` ignores hidden directories and files by default. It also ignores patterns\r\nfrom `.gitignore` files. If you want to make sure to find absolutely every possible file, always\r\nuse the options `-u`/`--unrestricted` option (or `-HI` to enable hidden and ignored files):\r\n``` bash\r\n> fd -u …\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Colorized output\r\n\r\n`fd` can colorize files by extension, just like `ls`. In order for this to work, the environment\r\nvariable [`LS_COLORS`](https://linux.die.net/man/5/dir_colors) has to be set. Typically, the value\r\nof this variable is set by the `dircolors` command which provides a convenient configuration format\r\nto define colors for different file formats.\r\nOn most distributions, `LS_COLORS` should be set already. If you are on Windows or if you are looking\r\nfor alternative, more complete (or more colorful) variants, see [here](https://github.com/sharkdp/vivid),\r\n[here](https://github.com/seebi/dircolors-solarized) or\r\n[here](https://github.com/trapd00r/LS_COLORS).\r\n\r\n`fd` also honors the [`NO_COLOR`](https://no-color.org/) environment variable.\r\n\r\n### `fd` doesn't seem to interpret my regex pattern correctly\r\n\r\nA lot of special regex characters (like `[]`, `^`, `$`, ..) are also special characters in your\r\nshell. If in doubt, always make sure to put single quotes around the regex pattern:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\n> fd '^[A-Z][0-9]+$'\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf your pattern starts with a dash, you have to add `--` to signal the end of command line\r\noptions. Otherwise, the pattern will be interpreted as a command-line option. Alternatively,\r\nuse a character class with a single hyphen character:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\n> fd -- '-pattern'\r\n> fd '[-]pattern'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### \"Command not found\" for `alias`es or shell functions\r\n\r\nShell `alias`es and shell functions can not be used for command execution via `fd -x` or\r\n`fd -X`. In `zsh`, you can make the alias global via `alias -g myalias=\"…\"`. In `bash`,\r\nyou can use `export -f my_function` to make available to child processes. You would still\r\nneed to call `fd -x bash -c 'my_function \"$1\"' bash`. For other use cases or shells, use\r\na (temporary) shell script.\r\n\r\n## Integration with other programs\r\n\r\n### Using fd with `fzf`\r\n\r\nYou can use *fd* to generate input for the command-line fuzzy finder [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf):\r\n``` bash\r\nexport FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND='fd --type file'\r\nexport FZF_CTRL_T_COMMAND=\"$FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, you can type `vim <Ctrl-T>` on your terminal to open fzf and search through the fd-results.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you might like to follow symbolic links and include hidden files (but exclude `.git` folders):\r\n``` bash\r\nexport FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND='fd --type file --follow --hidden --exclude .git'\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can even use fd's colored output inside fzf by setting:\r\n``` bash\r\nexport FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND=\"fd --type file --color=always\"\r\nexport FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS=\"--ansi\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor more details, see the [Tips section](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#tips) of the fzf README.\r\n\r\n### Using fd with `rofi`\r\n\r\n[*rofi*](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) is a graphical launch menu application that is able to create menus by reading from *stdin*. Piping `fd` output into `rofi`s `-dmenu` mode creates fuzzy-searchable lists of files and directories.\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\nCreate a case-insensitive searchable multi-select list of *PDF* files under your `$HOME` directory and open the selection with your configured PDF viewer. To list all file types, drop the `-e pdf` argument.\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\nfd --type f -e pdf . $HOME | rofi -keep-right -dmenu -i -p FILES -multi-select | xargs -I {} xdg-open {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo modify the list that is presented by rofi, add arguments to the `fd` command. To modify the search behaviour of rofi, add arguments to the `rofi` command.\r\n\r\n### Using fd with `emacs`\r\n\r\nThe emacs package [find-file-in-project](https://github.com/technomancy/find-file-in-project) can\r\nuse *fd* to find files.\r\n\r\nAfter installing `find-file-in-project`, add the line `(setq ffip-use-rust-fd t)` to your\r\n`~/.emacs` or `~/.emacs.d/init.el` file.\r\n\r\nIn emacs, run `M-x find-file-in-project-by-selected` to find matching files. Alternatively, run\r\n`M-x find-file-in-project` to list all available files in the project.\r\n\r\n### Printing the output as a tree\r\n\r\nTo format the output of `fd` as a file-tree you can use the `tree` command with\r\n`--fromfile`:\r\n```bash\r\n❯ fd | tree --fromfile\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis can be more useful than running `tree` by itself because `tree` does not\r\nignore any files by default, nor does it support as rich a set of options as\r\n`fd` does to control what to print:\r\n```bash\r\n❯ fd --extension rs | tree --fromfile\r\n.\r\n├── build.rs\r\n└── src\r\n    ├── app.rs\r\n    └── error.rs\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn bash and similar you can simply create an alias:\r\n```bash\r\n❯ alias as-tree='tree --fromfile'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Using fd with `xargs` or `parallel`\r\n\r\nNote that `fd` has a builtin feature for [command execution](#command-execution) with\r\nits `-x`/`--exec` and `-X`/`--exec-batch` options. If you prefer, you can still use\r\nit in combination with `xargs`:\r\n``` bash\r\n> fd -0 -e rs | xargs -0 wc -l\r\n```\r\nHere, the `-0` option tells *fd* to separate search results by the NULL character (instead of\r\nnewlines). In the same way, the `-0` option of `xargs` tells it to read the input in this way.\r\n\r\n\r\n### On Debian\r\n\r\nIf you run Debian Buster or newer, you can install the\r\n[officially maintained Debian package](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/rust-fd-find):\r\n```\r\napt-get install fd-find\r\n```\r\nNote that the binary is called `fdfind` as the binary name `fd` is already used by another package.\r\nIt is recommended that after installation, you add a link to `fd` by executing command\r\n`ln -s $(which fdfind) ~/.local/bin/fd`, in order to use `fd` in the same way as in this documentation.\r\nMake sure that `$HOME/.local/bin` is in your `$PATH`.\r\n\r\nNote that the .deb packages on the release page for this project still name the executable `fd`.\r\n\r\n### On Arch Linux\r\n\r\nYou can install [the fd package](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/fd/) from the official repos:\r\n```\r\npacman -S fd\r\n```\r\nYou can also install fd [from the AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/fd-git).\r\n\r\n### On Void Linux\r\n\r\nYou can install `fd` via xbps-install:\r\n```\r\nxbps-install -S fd\r\n```\r\n\r\n### From source\r\n\r\nWith Rust's package manager [cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo), you can install *fd* via:\r\n```\r\ncargo install fd-find\r\n```\r\nNote that rust version *1.77.2* or later is required.\r\n\r\n`make` is also needed for the build.\r\n\r\n### From binaries\r\n\r\nThe [release page](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd/releases) includes precompiled binaries for Linux, macOS and Windows. Statically-linked binaries are also available: look for archives with `musl` in the file name.\r\n\r\n## Development\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone https://github.com/sharkdp/fd\r\n\r\n# Build\r\ncd fd\r\ncargo build\r\n\r\n# Run unit tests and integration tests\r\ncargo test\r\n\r\n# Install\r\ncargo install --path .\r\n```\r\n",

More precisely,\r\n\r\n> `grep foo file` returns all the lines that _contain_ a string matching the expression \"foo\" in the file \"file\".\r\n\r\nFor now, we will just think of an expression as a string. So _grep_ returns all matching lines that contain foo as a substring.\r\n\r\nAnother way of using _grep_ is to have it accept data through `STDIN`. instead of having it search a file. For example,\r\n\r\n> `ls |grep blah` lists all files in the current directory whose names contain the string \"blah\"\r\n\r\n## Compatibility Notes\r\n\r\n[Back to top](#top)\r\n\r\nThis tutorial is based on the _GNU_ version of grep. It is recommended that you use this version. To use it, firstly, it needs to be installed on your system. Secondly, your **PATH** needs to be set so that GNU grep is used in preference to the standard version.\r\n\r\n## Wildcards For Grep\r\n\r\n[Back to top](#top)\r\n\r\n### The Basics: Wildcards for grep\r\n\r\n#### The Wildcard Character\r\n\r\nSo the first question that probably comes to mind is something like \"does this _grep thing_ support wildcards ? And the answer is better than yes. In fact saying that _grep_ supports wildcards is a big understatement. _grep_ uses _regular expressions_ which go a few steps beyond wildcards. But we will start with wildcards. The canonical wildcard character is the dot \".\" Here is an example :\r\n\r\n```\r\n>cat file\r\n\r\nbig\r\nbad bug \r\nbag\r\nbigger\r\nboogy\r\n\r\n>grep b.g file\r\n\r\nbig\r\nbad bug \r\nbag\r\nbigger\r\n```\r\n\r\nnotice that boogy didn't match, since the \".\" matches exactly one character.\r\n\r\n#### The repetition character\r\n\r\nTo match repetitions of a character, we use the star, which works in the following way:\r\n\r\n> _the expression consisting of a character followed by a star matches any number (possibly zero) of repetitions of that character. In particular, the expression \".\\*\" matches any string, and hence acts as a \"wildcard\"._\r\n\r\nTo illustrate, we show some examples:\r\n\r\n#### Examples: Wildcards\r\n\r\n|     |     |     |     |\r\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\r\n| #### The File for These Examples<br><br>`>cat file big bad bug  bag bigger boogy` | #### Wildcards #1<br><br>`>grep \"b.*g\" file big bad bug  bag bigger boogy` | #### Wildcards #2<br><br>`>grep \"b.*g.\" file bigger boogy` | #### repetition<br><br>`>grep \"ggg*\" file bigger` |\r\n\r\nRead the repetion example carefully, and pay careful attention to the fact that the \"\\*\" in grep patterns denotes _repetition_. It does _not_ behave as a wildcard in regular expression syntax (as it is in UNIX or DOS glob patterns). Recall that the pattern \".\\*\" behaves as a wildcard (because .\\* means \"repeat any character any number of times). The pattern \"g\\*\" matches the string \"\", \"g\", \"gg\", etc. Likewise, \"gg\\*\" matches \"g\", \"gg\", \"ggg\", so \"ggg\\*\" matches \"gg\", \"ggg\", \"gggg\", etc.\r\n\r\n## Taking it Further - Regular Expressions\r\n\r\n[Back to top](#top) The wildcards are a start, but the idea could be taken further. For example, suppose we want an expression that matches `Frederic Smith` or `Fred Smith`. In other words, the letters `eric` are \"optional\".\r\n\r\nFirst, we introduce the concept of an \"escaped\" character.\r\n\r\n> _An escaped character is a character preceded by a backslash. The preceding backslash does one of the following:  \r\n> (a) removes an implied special meaning from a character (b) adds special meaning to a \"non-special\" character_\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n\r\nTo search for a line containing text `hello.gif`, the correct command is\r\n\r\n> `grep 'hello\\.gif' file`\r\n\r\nsince `grep 'hello.gif' file` will match lines containing `hello-gif , hello1gif , helloagif` , etc.\r\n\r\nNow we move on to grouping expressions, in order to find a way of making an expression to match `Fred` or `Frederic`\r\n\r\nFirst, we start with the ? operator.\r\n\r\n> _an expression consisting of a character followed by an escaped question mark matches one or zero instances of that character._\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\n`bugg\\?y` matches all of the following: `bugy , buggy` but not `bugggy` We move on to \"grouping\" expressions. In our example, we want to make the string \"ederic\" following \"Fred\" optional, we don't just want one optional character.\r\n\r\n> _An expression surrounded by \"escaped\" parentheses is treated by a single character._\r\n\r\n#### Examples\r\n\r\n`Fred\\(eric\\)\\? Smith` matches `Fred Smith` or `Frederic Smith`  \r\n`\\(abc\\)*` matches `abc` , `abcabcabc` etc. (i.e. , any number of repetitions of the string `abc` , including the empty string.) Note that we have to be careful when our expressions contain white spaces or stars. When this happens, we need to enclose them in quotes so that the shell does not mis-interpret the command, because the shell will parse whitespace-separated strings as multiple arguments, and will expand an unquoted \\* to a glob pattern. So to use our example above, we would need to type\r\n\r\n> grep \"Fred\\\\(eric\\\\)\\\\? Smith\" file\r\n\r\nWe now mention several other useful operators.\r\n\r\n## More on Regular Expressions\r\n\r\n[Back to top](#top)\r\n\r\n### Matching a list of characters\r\n\r\n[Back to top](#top)  \r\nTo match a selection of characters, use \\[\\].\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n\r\n> `[Hh]ello` matches lines containing `hello` or `Hello`\r\n\r\nRanges of characters are also permitted.\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n\r\n> `[0-3]` is the same as `[0123]`  \r\n> `[a-k]` is the same as `[abcdefghijk]`  \r\n> `[A-C]` is the same as `[ABC]`  \r\n> `[A-Ca-k]` is the same as  \r\n> `[ABCabcdefghijk]`  \r\n\r\nThere are also some alternate forms :  \r\n\r\n> `[[:alpha:]]` is the same as `[a-zA-Z]`  \r\n> `[[:upper:]]` is the same as `[A-Z]`  \r\n> `[[:lower:]]` is the same as `[a-z]`  \r\n> `[[:digit:]]` is the same as `[0-9]`  \r\n> `[[:alnum:]]` is the same as `[0-9a-zA-Z]`  \r\n> `[[:space:]]` matches any white space including tabs  \r\n\r\nThese alternate forms such as `[[:digit:]]` are preferable to the direct method `[0-9]`\r\n\r\nThe \\[\\] may be used to search for _non-matches_. This is done by putting a carat ^ as the first character inside the square brackets.\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\n`grep \"([^()]*)a\" file` returns any line containing a pair of parentheses that are innermost and are followed by the letter \"a\". So it matches these lines\r\n\r\n(hello)a\r\n(aksjdhaksj d ka)a\r\n\r\nBut not this\r\n\r\nx=(y+2(x+1))a\r\n\r\n### Matching a Specific Number Of Repetitions of a Pattern\r\n\r\n[Back to top](#top)  \r\nSuppose you want to match a specific number of repetitions of a pattern. A good example is phone numbers. You could search for a 7 digit phone number like this:\r\n\r\n> `grep \"[[:digit:]]\\{3\\}[ -]\\?[[:digit:]]\\{4\\}\" file`\r\n\r\nThis matches phone numbers, possibly containing a dash or whitespace in the middle.\r\n\r\n### Nailing it Down to Start of the Line and End of the Line\r\n\r\n[Back to top](#top)  \r\nHere's the deal. Suppose you want to search for lines containing a line consisting of white space, then the word hello, then the end of the line. Let us start with an example.\r\n\r\n> \\>cat file\r\n> \r\n> \thello\r\n> hello world\r\n> \thhello\r\n> \r\n> >grep hello file\r\n> \r\n> \thello\r\n> hello world\r\n> \thhello\r\n\r\nThis is _not_ what we wanted. So what went wrong ? The problem is that grep searches for lines containing the string \"hello\" , and all the lines specified contain this. To get around this problem, we introduce the end and beginning of line characters\r\n\r\n> _The $ character matches the end of the line. The ^ character matches the beginning of the line._\r\n\r\n#### Examples\r\n\r\nreturning to our previous example,\r\n\r\n> `grep \"^[[:space:]]*hello[[:space:]]*$\" file`\r\n\r\ndoes what we want (only returns one line) Another example:  \r\n`grep \"^From.*mscharmi\" /var/spool/mail/elflord` searches my inbox for headers from a particular person. This kind of regular expression is extremely useful, and mail filters such as procmail use it all the tims.\r\n\r\n### This or That: matching one of two strings\r\n\r\n[Back to top](#top)\r\n\r\n> _The expression consisting of two expressions seperated by the or operator `\\|` matches lines containing either of those two expressions._\r\n\r\nNote that you _MUST_ enclose this inside single or double quotes.\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\n`grep \"cat\\|dog\" file` matches lines containing the word \"cat\" or the word \"dog\"  \r\n`grep \"I am a \\(cat\\|dog\\)\"` matches lines containing the string \"I am a cat\" or the string \"I am a dog\".\r\n\r\n### Backpedalling and Backreferences\r\n\r\n[Back to top](#top)  \r\nSuppose you want to search for a string which contains a certain substring in more than one place. An example is the heading tag in HTML. Suppose I wanted to search for `<H1>some string</H1>` . This is easy enough to do. But suppose I wanted to do the same but allow `H2 H3 H4 H5 H6` in place of `H1`. The expression `<H[1-6]>.*</H[1-6]>` is not good enough since it matches `<H1>Hello world</H3>` but we want the opening tag to match the closing one. To do this, we use a _backreference_\r\n\r\n> _The expression \\\\n where n is a number, matches the contents of the n'th set of parentheses in the expression_\r\n\r\nWoah, this really needs an example!\r\n\r\n#### Examples\r\n\r\n`<H\\([1-6]\\).*</H\\1>` matches what we were trying to match before.  \r\n`\"Mr \\(dog\\|cat\\) came home to Mrs \\1 and they went to visit Mr \\(dog\\|cat\\) and Mrs \\2 to discuss the meaning of life` matches ... well I'm sure you can work it out. the idea is that the cats and dogs should match up in such a way that it makes sense.\r\n\r\n## Some Crucial Details: Special Characters and Quotes\r\n\r\n[Back to top](#top)  \r\n\r\n### Special Characters\r\n\r\n[Back to top](#top)  \r\nHere, we outline the special characters for grep. Note that in egrep (which uses extended regular expressions), which actually are no more functional than standard regular expressions if you use GNU grep ) , the list of special characters increases ( | in grep is the same as \\\\| egrep and vice versa, there are also other differences. Check the man page for details ) The following characters are considered special and need to be \"escaped\":\r\n\r\n> ?  \\\\  .  \\[  \\]  ^  $\r\n\r\nNote that a $ sign loses its meaning if characters follow it (I think) and the carat ^ loses its meaning if other characters precede it.  \r\nSquare brackets behave a little differently. The rules for square brackets go as follows:\r\n\r\n*   A closing square bracket loses its special meaning if placed first in a list. for example `[]12]` matches \\] , 1, or 2.\r\n*   A dash - loses it's usual meaning inside lists if it is placed last.\r\n*   A carat ^ loses it's special meaning if it is not placed first\r\n*   Most special characters lose their meaning inside square brackets\r\n\r\n### Quotes\r\n\r\n[Back to top](#top)  \r\nFirstly, single quotes are the safest to use, because they protect your regular expression from the shell. For example, `grep \"!\" file` will often produce an error (since the shell thinks that \"!\" is referring to the shell command history) while `grep '!' file` will not.\r\n\r\nWhen should you use single quotes ? the answer is this: if you want to use shell variables, you need double quotes. For example,\r\n\r\n> `grep \"$HOME\" file`\r\n\r\nsearches file for the name of your home directory, while\r\n\r\n> `grep '$HOME' file`\r\n\r\nsearches for the string $HOME\r\n\r\n## Extended Regular Expression Syntax\r\n\r\n[Back to top](#top)\r\n\r\nWe now discuss egrep syntax as opposed to grep syntax. Ironically, despite the origin of the name (extended), egrep actually has _less_ functionality as it is designed for compatibility with the traditional egrep. A better way to do an extended \"grep\" is to use `grep -E` which uses extended regular expression syntax without loss of functionality.\r\n\r\n\r\n| grep | grep -E | Available for egrep? |\r\n --- | --- | --- |\r\n| `a\\+` | `a+` | yes |\r\n| `a\\?` | `a?` | yes |\r\n| `expression1\\\\|expression2` | `expression1\\|expression2?` | yes |\r\n| `\\(expression\\)` | `(expression1)` | yes |\r\n| `\\{m,n\\}` | `{m,n}` | no  |\r\n| `\\{,n\\}` | `{,n}` | no  |\r\n| `\\{m,}` | `{m,}` | no  |\r\n| `\\{m}` | `{m}` | no  |",

I’ve only included ones here that aren’t commonly listed elsewhere.\r\n\r\n## But first, a word about Working Directories & Variables\r\n\r\n### Working Directory\r\n\r\nThe current working directory for the a custom action, is the folder the Thunar window that launched the action, is currently displaying. You can test this by creating and running the following custom action:\r\n\r\n#### Test CWD\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n\r\nPrints out the current working directory\r\n\r\nCommand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<span class=\"nb\">pwd</span> | zenity <span class=\"nt\">--text-info</span>\r\n```\r\n\r\nFile Pattern\r\n\r\n`*`\r\n\r\nAppears if selection contains\r\n\r\nDirectories\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n\r\n```\r\n<span class=\"nb\">sudo </span>apt-get <span class=\"nb\">install </span>zenity\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis means that you can use just filenames without a path in your custom actions to refer to a file in the current folder. This means that you can use the `%N` variable to process a list of selected files, instead if having to use the `%F` variable which includes the full pathname - this is handy for renaming just the files, without tampering with the pathname, for example.\r\n\r\n### Variables\r\n\r\nThunar custom actions can contain variable parameters, that get substituted with the actual value when you run the action. These allow you to refer to the files that are currently selected in Thunar when running your actions, without knowing in advance which ones. The following variables are available:\r\n\r\n| This… | is replaced at runtime with this… |\r\n| --- | --- |\r\n| %f | The path to the first selected file |\r\n| %F | The paths to all the selected files |\r\n| %d | Directory containing the file referred to by %f |\r\n| %D | Directories containing the files referred to by %F |\r\n| %n | The first selected filename, without the path |\r\n| %N | All the selected filenames, without paths |\r\n\r\nYou can see examples of these variables in use below.\r\n\r\n## My Thunar Custom Actions\r\n\r\nTo use these yourself, copy and paste these names,

      "content": "Cortile Help  \r\n\r\nLinux auto tiling manager with hot corner support for Openbox, Fluxbox, IceWM, Xfwm, KWin, Marco, Muffin, Mutter and other [EWMH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Window_Manager_Hints#List_of_window_managers_that_support_Extended_Window_Manager_Hints) compliant window managers using the [X11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System) window system.\r\nTherefore, this project provides dynamic tiling for XFCE, LXDE, LXQt, KDE and GNOME (Mate, Deepin, Cinnamon, Budgie) based desktop environments.\r\n\r\nSimply keep your current window manager and install **cortile on top** of it.\r\nOnce enabled, the tiling manager will handle _resizing_ and _positioning_ of _existing_ and _new_ windows.\r\n<br clear=\"left\"/>\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n- [x] Workspace based tiling.\r\n- [x] Auto detection of panels.\r\n- [x] Toggle window decorations.\r\n- [x] User interface for tiling mode.\r\n- [x] Systray icon indicator and menu.\r\n- [x] Custom addons via python bindings.\r\n- [x] Keyboard, hot corner and systray bindings.\r\n- [x] Vertical, horizontal, maximized and fullscreen mode.\r\n- [x] Remember layout proportions.\r\n- [x] Floating and sticky windows.\r\n- [x] Drag & drop window swap.\r\n- [x] Workplace aware layouts.\r\n- [x] Multi monitor support.\r\n\r\nSupport for **keyboard and mouse** events sets cortile apart from other tiling solutions.\r\nThe _go_ implementation ensures a fast and responsive system, where _multiple layouts_, _keyboard shortcuts_, _drag & drop_ and _hot corner_ events simplify and speed up your daily work.\r\n\r\n[![demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leukipp/cortile/main/assets/images/demo.gif)](https://github.com/leukipp/cortile/blob/main/assets/images/demo.gif)\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nManually [download](https://github.com/leukipp/cortile/releases/latest) the latest binary file from [releases](https://github.com/leukipp/cortile/releases/latest) or use wget:\r\n```bash\r\nwget -qO- $(wget -qO- https://api.github.com/repos/leukipp/cortile/releases/latest | \\\r\njq -r '.assets[] | select(.name | contains (\"linux_amd64.tar.gz\")) | .browser_download_url') | \\\r\ntar -xvz\r\n```\r\n\r\nExecute the binary file and cortile will automatically begin tiling windows until you choose to stop it:\r\n```bash\r\n./cortile\r\n```\r\nAnother installation method can be found in the [development](#development-) section.\r\nThe latest official release is published on GitHub.\r\nVersions distributed via package managers are community supported and may be outdated.\r\n\r\n### Service\r\nTo enable auto tiling on startup, you can run cortile as a service after the graphical user interface has been loaded.\r\nA template to run cortile as a [systemd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd) service is provided in the [services](https://github.com/leukipp/cortile/tree/main/assets/services) folder.\r\nYou may have to adjust the filepath/symlink under `ExecStart` and enable the user service:\r\n```bash\r\n# copy systemd service file\r\ncp cortile.service ~/.config/systemd/user/\r\n\r\n# reload systemd configuration\r\nsystemctl --user daemon-reload\r\n\r\n# enable systemd service\r\nsystemctl --user enable cortile.service\r\n\r\n# start systemd service\r\nsystemctl --user start cortile.service\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\nThe layouts are based on the master-slave concept, where one side of the screen is considered to be the master area and the other side is considered to be the slave area:\r\n- `vertical-right:` split the screen vertically, master area on the right.\r\n- `vertical-left:` split the screen vertically, master area on the left.\r\n- `horizontal-top:` split the screen horizontally, master area on the top.\r\n- `horizontal-bottom:` split the screen horizontally, master area on the bottom.\r\n- `maximized:` single window that fills the entire tiling area.\r\n- `fullscreen:` single window that fills the entire screen.\r\n\r\nThe number of windows per side and the occupied space can be changed dynamically.\r\nAdjustments to window sizes are considered to be proportion changes of the underlying layout.\r\n\r\nWindows placed on the master side are static and the layout will only change as long the space is not fully occupied.\r\nOnce the master area is full, the slave area is used, where the layout changes dynamically based on available space and configuration settings.\r\n\r\n### Configuration  \r\n\r\nThe configuration file is located at `~/.config/cortile/config.toml` (or `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`) and is created with default values during the first startup.\r\nAdditional information about individual entries can be found in the comments section of the [config.toml](https://github.com/leukipp/cortile/blob/main/config.toml) file.\r\n\r\n[![config](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leukipp/cortile/main/assets/images/config.gif)](https://github.com/leukipp/cortile/blob/main/assets/images/config.gif)\r\n\r\n### Shortcuts\r\nThe default keyboard shortcuts are assigned as shown below. If some of them are  \r\nalready in use by your system, update the default values in the `[keys]` section of the configuration file:\r\n| Keys                                                    |

may communicate with cortile by using [dbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-Bus) directly or via the [cortile-addons](https://github.com/leukipp/cortile-addons) python bindings.\r\n\r\n### D-Bus\r\nRunning `cortile` starts a dbus server instance that makes internal properties and method calls available.\r\nSince using dbus communication directly with an external process, bash script, etc. is possible, the development requires some knowledge of dbus and is quite messy.\r\n\r\nTherefore, there is a built-in dbus client incorporated in the same cortile binary that can be started via `cortile dbus -...` as a secondary process.\r\nThis client instance communicates with the running server instance and allows to listen for events and to execute remote procedure calls.\r\n\r\nThe documentation of available properties and method calls can be found via `cortile dbus -help`.\r\n\r\n### Python\r\nAdditional python bindings are available to further simplify communication with cortile and to build a community-based library of useful snippets and examples.\r\n\r\nFor simplicity, the python bindings just spawn another cortile instance via `cortile dbus -...` running in the background and wrapping all available interfaces in easy-to-use python methods.\r\n\r\nExample scripts and detailed information's on how to get started can be found in the [cortile-addons](https://github.com/leukipp/cortile-addons) repository.\r\n\r\n### Development \r\nYou need [go >= 1.22](https://go.dev/dl/) to compile cortile.\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Install - go</summary><div>\r\n\r\n### Option 1: Install go via package manager\r\nUse a package manager supported on your system:\r\n```\r\nbash\r\n# apt\r\nsudo apt install golang\r\n\r\n# yum\r\nsudo yum install golang\r\n\r\n# dnf\r\nsudo dnf install golang\r\n\r\n# pacman\r\nsudo pacman -S go\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Option 2: Install go via archive download\r\nDownload a binary release suitable for your system:\r\n```bash\r\ncd /tmp/ && wget https://dl.google.com/go/go1.22.8.linux-amd64.tar.gz\r\nsudo tar -xvf go1.22.8.linux-amd64.tar.gz\r\nsudo mv -fi go /usr/local\r\n```\r\n\r\nSet required environment variables:\r\n```bash\r\necho \"export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin\" >> ~/.profile\r\necho \"export GOPATH=~/.go\" >> ~/.profile\r\nsource ~/.profile\r\n```\r\n\r\n</div></details>\r\n\r\nVerify the installed go version:\r\n```bash\r\ngo env | grep \"GOPATH\\|GOVERSION\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Install - cortile</summary><div>\r\n\r\n### Option 1: Install cortile via remote source\r\nInstall directly from develop branch:\r\n```bash\r\ngo install github.com/leukipp/cortile/v2@develop\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Option 2: Install cortile via local source\r\nClone source code from develop branch:\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone https://github.com/leukipp/cortile.git -b develop\r\ncd cortile\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf necessary you can make local changes, then execute:\r\n```bash\r\ngo install -ldflags=\"-X 'main.date=$(date --iso-8601=seconds)'\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n</div></details>\r\n\r\nStart cortile in verbose mode:\r\n```bash\r\n$GOPATH/bin/cortile -v\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Additional [![additional](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-pr-closed/leukipp/cortile?style=flat-square)](#additional-)\r\nSpecial use cases:\r\n- Use the `window_slaves_max` property to limit the number of windows.\r\n  - e.g. with one active master and `window_slaves_max = 2`, all windows following the third window are stacked behind the two slaves.\r\n- Use the `edge_margin` property to account for additional spaces.\r\n  - e.g. for deskbar panels or conky infographics.\r\n- Use `tiling_enabled = false` if you prefer to enable tiling only when needed.\r\n  - e.g. or to mainly utilize the hot corner functionalities.\r\n- Use [cortile-addons](https://github.com/leukipp/cortile-addons) if you need any other specific logic.\r\n  This repository offers a range of extensions and enhancements specifically designed for cortile.\r\n\r\nSecurity concerns:\r\n- Since the [dbus api](https://github.com/leukipp/cortile/tree/develop?tab=readme-ov-file#addons-) exposes internal cortile properties to the outside, malicious code running on the same host could easily access them.\r\n  However, the information cortile holds (e.g. about open windows) can also be accessed using other tools interfacing with the X11 window system.\r\n  Therefore the decision was made that direct access to cortile provides greater flexibility for running custom logic without compromising security.\r\n  - If you want to disable this feature run cortile with `cortile disable-dbus-interface`.\r\n- Any scripts placed in the `~/.config/cortile/addons/` folder will be executed when the application starts.\r\n  This provides the possibility to run custom [cortile-addons](https://github.com/leukipp/cortile/tree/develop?tab=readme-ov-file#addons-) scripts without worrying much about startup behavior and dependency issues.\r\n  However, it also creates a potential security risk, as malicious code could place files in this folder to be executed by cortile.\r\n  - If you want to disable this feature run cortile with `cortile disable-addons-folder`.\r\n- Newly pinned issues appear as menu entries in a submenu within the systray.\r\n  This feature requires a network request to the GitHub API.\r\n  - If you want to disable this feature run cortile with `cortile disable-issue-info`.\r\n- Cortile checks for new releases and provides the option for an in-place upgrade of the current binary.\r\n  Similar to the GitHub issue information, this feature also requires a network request.\r\n  - If you want to disable this feature run cortile with `cortile disable-release-info`.  \r\n- The binary file runs perfectly fine with user permissions.\r\n  - Do not run cortile as root!\r\n\r\n## Issues [![issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-closed/leukipp/cortile?style=flat-square)](#issues-)\r\nCortile works best with Xfwm and Openbox window systems.\r\nHowever, it`s still possible that you may encounter problems during usage.\r\n\r\nWindows:\r\n- It's recommended to disable all build-in window snapping features (e.g. snap to other windows, snap to screen borders).\r\n- It's recommended to disable any logic that changes the window focus other than by clicking or opening a window (e.g. focus follow mouse, scroll wheel focus). \r\n- Automatic panel detection may not work under some window managers, use the `edge_margin` property to adjust for additional margins.\r\n- Particularly in GNOME based desktop environments, window displacements or resizing issues may occur.\r\n- Sticky windows may cause unwanted layout modifications during workspace changes.\r\n- Toggling window decoration may cause unwanted layout modifications.\r\n\r\nSystray:\r\n- Adjust the bindings in the `[systray]` section, as some pointer events may not fire across different desktop environments.\r\n- Window managers not supporting [StatusNotifierItem](https://freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/StatusNotifierItem) for displaying systray icons will need to install [snixembed](https://github.com/fyne-io/systray#linuxbsd).\r\n\r\nDebugging:\r\n- If you encounter problems start the process with `cortile -vv`, which provides additional debug outputs.\r\n- A log file is created by default under `/tmp/cortile.log`.\r\n\r\n## Credits [![credits](https://img.shields.io/github/contributors/leukipp/cortile?style=flat-square)](#credits-)\r\nBased on

      "content": "Auto Mounting Drives on Linux\r\n\r\n\r\n\"In this guide, we'll explore two popular methods for automatically mounting drives on Linux:\"\r\n\r\n1. Configuring the fstab file for startup mounting\r\n2. Using udev and autofs for more dynamic setups\r\n\r\nLet's see them one by one.\r\n\r\n**Method 1: Automount with fstab at Startup**\r\n\r\nIf you want the external drive to automatically mount whenever your system starts, you can configure it using fstab (File Systems Table).\r\n\r\nThis method is reliable for drives that remain connected during system boot and I mostly use this method for my homelab.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/10/lsblk-command-to-list-drives.png\" alt=\"lsblk command example\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\">\r\n\r\n\r\n##![image](https://itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/10/lsblk-command-to-list-drives.png)##\r\n\r\n*I have a 1.5TB HDD connected to my server and I need to automount the /sdb2 partition.*\r\n\r\n#### Steps to Automount via fstab:\r\n\r\n1. First, connect your USB drive and run the following command to identify the device name and UUID:\r\n\r\n`sudo blkid`\r\n\r\n   Look for the line that corresponds to your external drive. For instance:\r\n\r\n   ```\r\n   /dev/sdb2: UUID=\"12ab345cd-1234-4166-8539-ff4ff3ff2ff1\" TYPE=\"ntfs\"\r\n   ```\r\n   ![](https://itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/10/blkid-to-know-uuid.png)\r\n\r\n2. Edit the `/etc/fstab` file with your preferred text editor (you'll need super-user rights):\r\n\r\n   `sudo nano /etc/fstab`\r\n\r\n   Add the following line at the end of the file:\r\n\r\n` UUID=12ab345cd-1234-4166-8539-ff4ff3ff2ff1 /media/hdd auto defaults,nofail,x-systemd.automount 0 2`\r\n\r\nReplace the UUID with the one from your drive, and adjust the mount point **/media/hdd** as per your requirement.  \r\n\r\n![image](https://itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/10/editing-the-fstab-1.png)\r\n\r\n3. Reload systemd to apply the changes:\r\n\r\n`sudo systemctl daemon-reload`\r\n\r\n   Then reboot your system, and the drive should automatically mount at the specified location. \r\n\r\n   ![image](https://itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/10/automount-at-boot.png)\r\n\r\n>💡 The same method can also be utilized when you are using a dual boot system and you want   \r\nto automount the Windows partition(s).\r\n\r\n#### Method 2: Automount Using Udev Rules and autofs\r\n\r\nIf you want the external drive to mount only when it's plugged in, udev rules and autofs provide a dynamic approach.\r\n\r\nThis method is more suitable if you frequently swap USB drives or prefer not to have them mounted at startup.\r\n\r\n#### Steps to Automount Using udev and autofs:\r\n\r\n1. Create a new rule file in the `/etc/udev/rules.d/` directory:\r\n\r\n`sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/usb_auto_mount.rules`\r\n\r\nAdd the following content:\r\n\r\n   ```\r\n   ACTION==\"add\", KERNEL==\"sd*\", ENV{DEVTYPE}==\"partition\", ENV{ID_BUS}==\"usb\", \\\r\n       SYMLINK+=\"usbdisks/%k\", MODE:=\"0660\", \\\r\n       RUN+=\"/bin/ln -sf /media/hdd/%k /media/usb-sticks/%k\"\r\n   ACTION==\"remove\", KERNEL==\"sd*\", ENV{DEVTYPE}==\"partition\", ENV{ID_BUS}==\"usb\", \\\r\n       RUN+=\"/bin/rm /media/usb-sticks/%k\"\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n\r\n**Breakdown of the udev rules:**\r\n\r\n1. **ACTION==\"add\"** This rule triggers when a new device (like a USB) is added.\r\n2. **KERNEL==\"sd*\"** Matches devices whose kernel name starts with **\"sd\"** (typical for drives).\r\n3. **ENV{DEVTYPE}==\"partition\"**  Ensures that only partitioned devices are targeted.\r\n4. **ENV{ID_BUS}==\"usb\"** Limits this rule to USB devices.\r\n5. **SYMLINK+=\"usbdisks/%k\"** Creates a symbolic link in **/dev/usbdisks/** for the device **%k** is a placeholder for the device name assigned by the kernel.\r\n6. **MODE:=\"0660\"** Sets read and write permissions for the user and group (but not others).\r\n7. **RUN+=\"/bin/ln -sf /media/hdd/%k /media/usb-sticks/%k\"** Creates a symbolic link in **/media/usb-sticks/** pointing to **/media/hdd/%k** where the drive will be mounted.\r\n8. **ACTION==\"remove\"** This rule is triggered when the USB drive is unplugged.\r\n9. **RUN+=\"/bin/rm /media/usb-sticks/%k\"** Removes the symbolic link when the drive is disconnected.\r\n\r\n![image](https://itsfoss.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/10/udev-rule-file-1.png)  \r\n*Editing the udev file:*\r\n\r\nAfter creating the udev rules file, you need to reload the udev rules to apply the changes:\r\n\r\n`sudo udevadm control --reload-rules`\r\n\r\nThis command ensures that the new rules are recognized by the system.\r\n\r\n#### Editing the udev file \r\n\r\n2. After saving the file, reload the udev rules to apply the changes:\r\n\r\n`sudo udevadm control --reload-rules`\r\n\r\n3. Edit the `auto.master` file to instruct autofs to mount the USB drive:\r\n\r\n`sudo nano /etc/auto.master`\r\n\r\nAdd the following line:\r\n\r\n`/media/hdd /etc/auto_mount.usb --timeout=60`\r\n\r\n![iamge](https://itsfoss.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/10/mount-timeout-settings-1.png)  \r\n\r\nThen, create the corresponding automount map file:\r\n\r\n`sudo nano /etc/auto_mount.usb`\r\n\r\n   The add this content:\r\n\r\n   ```\r\n   #!/bin/bash\r\n   fstype=$(/sbin/blkid -o value -s TYPE /dev/usbdisks/${1})\r\n   if [ \"${fstype}\" = \"vfat\" ] ; then\r\n     echo \"-fstype=ntfs,sync,uid=0,gid=plugdev,umask=007 :/dev/usbdisks/${key}\"\r\n     exit 0\r\n   fi\r\n   exit 1\r\n   ```  \r\n**Breakdown of the auto_mount.usb script:**  \r\n\r\n1. **fstype=$(/sbin/blkid -o value -s TYPE /dev/usbdisks/${1})**  This command fetches the file system type (e.g., FAT32, NTFS) of the USB drive using the `blkid` command.\r\n2. **if [ \"${fstype}\" = \"vfat\" ] ; then** Checks if the file system is `vfat`, which is a common file system type used by Windows.\r\n3. **echo \"-fstype=ntfs,sync,uid=0,gid=plugdev,umask=007 :/dev/usbdisks/${key}\"** Mounts the drive with the following specific options:\r\n   - **fstype=ntfs** Mounts the drive as an NTFS file system.\r\n   - **sync**  Ensures that data is written to the drive immediately rather than being cached.\r\n   - **uid=0,gid=plugdev**  Sets the owner to root (uid 0) and the group to `plugdev` (a common group for USB devices).\r\n  - **umask=007** Sets the permissions for files and directories so that only the owner and group can access them.\r\n4. **exit 0** Exits the script with a successful status.\r\n5. **fi** Ends the `if` statement.\r\n6. **exit 1** Exits the script with a failure status.  \r\n\r\n>💡 This script is used by the **auto_mount.usb** file to handle the mounting and unmounting of USB   \r\ndrives based on their file system type.\r\n\r\n![image](https://itsfoss.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/10/automount-final-script-for-udev-1.png)  \r\n\r\n*Save and exit file.*\r\n\r\nThe drive will now automatically mount in `/media/hdd/` when connected and unmount after 60 seconds of inactivity.\r\n\r\n#### Tips for Automounting External Drives\r\n\r\n-  Use UUIDs: When using fstab, always prefer UUIDs over /dev/sdX identifiers as they remain consistent across reboots.\r\n- Check Filesystem Support: Ensure that your system supports the filesystem of your USB drive (e.g., install ntfs-3g for NTFS drives).\r\n- Test Changes: Always test your configuration changes after setting them up to ensure the drive mounts properly. Using journalctl can help diagnose any issues.\r\n",

      "content": "Manage Kernel Modules with modprobe\r\n\r\nLinux systems utilize the `modprobe` command to add and remove device drivers, referred to as modules in the Linux environment. Unlike MS-Windows, where the term \"device driver\" is commonly used, Linux distinguishes these components as \"modules.\" At boot time, only a minimal kernel is loaded into memory, and additional hardware requires the corresponding modules to be loaded. The `modprobe` command intelligently manages these modules.\r\n\r\n### Tutorial Details\r\n\r\n- **Difficulty Level:** Easy\r\n- **Root Privileges:** Yes\r\n- **Requirements:** Linux terminal\r\n- **Category:** System Management\r\n- **OS Compatibility:** AlmaLinux, Alpine, Amazon Linux, Arch, CentOS, Debian, Fedora, Linux Mint, openSUSE, Pop!_OS, RHEL, Rocky, Slackware, Stream, SUSE, Ubuntu\r\n- **Estimated Reading Time:** 3 minutes\r\n\r\n### Listing Linux Kernel Modules\r\n\r\nAll Linux kernel modules are typically stored in the directory `/lib/modules/$(uname -r)`. To view the current modules, execute the following command:\r\n\r\n`ls /lib/modules/$(uname -r)`\r\n\r\n#### Sample Output\r\n\r\n```\r\nbuild                modules.ccwmap       modules.order\r\ninitrd               modules.dep          modules.pcimap\r\nkernel               modules.dep.bin      modules.seriomap\r\nmisc                 modules.devname      modules.softdep\r\nmodules.alias        modules.ieee1394map  modules.symbols\r\nmodules.alias.bin    modules.inputmap     modules.symbols.bin\r\nmodules.builtin      modules.isapnpmap    modules.usbmap\r\nmodules.builtin.bin  modules.ofmap        updates\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo list all drivers for various devices, use:\r\n\r\n`ls /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/drivers/`\r\n\r\n### Adding a Module (Driver)\r\n\r\nTo add a module called `foo`, run the following command as the root user:\r\n\r\n`modprobe foo`\r\n\r\nFor example, to load the `i8k` module, enter:\r\n\r\n`modprobe -v i8k`\r\n\r\n#### Sample Output\r\n\r\n```\r\ninsmod /lib/modules/3.5.0-30-generic/kernel/drivers/char/i8k.ko\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Finding Information About a Loaded Module\r\n\r\nTo view information about a specific Linux kernel module, use the `modinfo` command:\r\n\r\n`modinfo i8k`\r\n\r\n### Listing All Loaded Modules\r\n\r\nTo display the status of all loaded modules in the Linux kernel, use:\r\n\r\n`lsmod`\r\n\r\n#### Sample Output\r\n\r\n```\r\nModule                  Size  Used by\r\nsmbfs                  75465  0\r\nmd5                     5953  1\r\nipv6                  284193  10\r\n...\r\nscsi_mod              141457  2 libata,sd_mod\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Removing a Module\r\n\r\nTo remove a module called `foo`, use the `-r` option with `modprobe`:\r\n\r\n`modprobe -r foo`\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can use the `rmmod` command:\r\n\r\n`rmmod foo`\r\n\r\n### Configuring Linux Drivers to Automatically Load at Boot Time\r\n\r\nTo configure modules to load automatically at boot time, create a new configuration file in the `/etc/modules-load.d/` directory. First, navigate to that directory:\r\n\r\n`cd /etc/modules-load.d/`\r\n\r\nNext, create a `.conf` file, for example, `foo-driver.conf`:\r\n\r\n`sudo vim foo-driver.conf`\r\n\r\nAdd the names of the kernel modules you want to autoload, one per line:\r\n\r\n```plaintext\r\n# /etc/modules-load.d/foo-driver.conf\r\n# Load my custom compiled driver:\r\nfoo1\r\nbar2\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Note:** While `/etc/modules` is also a configuration file for loading modules at boot time, it is recommended to create a new file in the `/etc/modules-load.d/` directory for modern Linux systems using `systemd`.\r\n\r\n### Summing Up\r\n\r\nIn this tutorial, you learned how to use various Linux commands to list, add, and remove kernel modules in the current Linux kernel. For more information, refer to the manual pages using the `man` command:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nman modinfo\r\nman lsmod\r\nman insmod\r\nman modprobe\r\n```",

      "content": "### How to Modernize Your Bash Scripts with a GUI\r\n\r\nBash scripts are a set of instructions written in Bash command language, executed in Unix shell interpreters. They automate tasks, but interactions are limited to the command line interface. To make scripts more user-friendly, especially for non-technical audiences, you can add a GUI (Graphical User Interface) using the `Zenity` command line tool.\r\n\r\n### Message Boxes\r\n\r\nDisplaying completion messages or errors with native message boxes is more user-friendly than printing raw text in the console. `Zenity` can generate Error, Info, Question, and Warning type message boxes.\r\n\r\n* Information message box: `zenity --info --title=\"Installation complete\" --text=\"Please restart the system\" --no-wrap`\r\n* Warning message box: `zenity --warning --title=\"Battery low\" --text=\"Please plug your computer\" --no-wrap`\r\n* Error message box: `zenity --error --title=\"Error\" --text=\"Unable to delete app.log (ERR: 565)\" --no-wrap`\r\n* Question message box: `if zenity --question --title=\"Confirm deletion\" --text=\"Are you sure you want to delete this file?\" --no-wrap; then zenity --info --title=\"Success\" --text=\"app.log was removed\" --no-wrap; fi`\r\n\r\n### Notifications\r\n\r\nNative notifications can be generated using the `notify-send` command line tool, keeping users informed about long-running batch instructions.\r\n\r\n* Example: `notify-send \"File Downloader\" \"Download complete: app.log\"`\r\n\r\n### Input Elements\r\n\r\n`Zenity` offers various input elements for collecting user input.\r\n\r\n* Calendar input box: `I=$(zenity --calendar); zenity --info --text=\"Selected date: $I\" --no-wrap`\r\n* String input box: `NAME=$(zenity --entry --title=\"Please enter your name\"); if [ -n \"$NAME\" ]; then zenity --info --text=\"Hello $NAME\" --no-wrap; fi`\r\n* Password input box: `zenity --password` can capture a secret string, with optional username field.\r\n* File selection dialog: `zenity --file-selection --title=\"Select a file\"`\r\n\r\n### List Selections\r\n\r\nGUI-based list selection can improve user experience when asking for choices.\r\n\r\n* Example: `zenity --list --title=\"Choose an auth plugin\" --column=\"Id\" --column=\"Name\" googleauth \"Google authenticator\" msauth \"Microsoft authenticator\" authy \"Authy authenticator\"`\r\n\r\n### Advanced Example\r\n\r\nBy combining these native GUI elements, you can create more advanced and user-friendly bash scripts.",

      "content": "How to use and edit **password_generator** script  \r\n\r\n>💡 You can double click on this script to run it or assign an alias and run it with a cmd.\r\n\r\nPlace the script in a fave location. You can use an alias to run this script in the terminal. My alias is `genpass` and in the `bash_alias` the cmd looks\r\nlike this\r\n\r\n```\r\nalias genpass='bash /home/lee/Documents/Scripts/password_generator.sh'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How to: \r\nOpen a terminal and type 'genpass' (no quotes) and the length of the password req. e,g, \r\n\r\nfor 8 characters\r\n```\r\ngenpass 12 \r\n\r\n```\r\nfor 12 characters\r\n\r\n```\r\ngenpass 8\r\n```\r\nhit enter, terminal output example:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngenpass 12 Random Password: T*3obXhfmWMz`\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo modify the script so that it accepts a length parameter, you need to \r\nmake a few changes. Here’s how to do it step by step:\r\n\r\n### Step 1: Modify the Script\r\n\r\n1. **Open your script**: Browse to your *\"generate_password.sh\"* and open it \r\nwith a text editor. You can also use the terminal to edit the script\r\n\r\n`mousepad location/of/the/script_name.sh`\r\n\r\n2. **Modify the script**: Update the script to accept a command-line argument\r\nfor the password length. Here’s the modified version of the script:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n#!/bin/bash\r\n\r\n# Function to generate a random password\r\ngenerate_random_password() {\r\n    local length=$1\r\n    # Define the character set\r\n    local charset='abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789!@#$%^&*()'\r\n    \r\n    # Generate the password\r\n    local password=$(cat /dev/urandom | tr -dc \"$charset\" | fold -s -w \"$length\" | head -n 1)\r\n    \r\n    echo \"$password\"\r\n}\r\n\r\n# Check if a length argument is provided\r\nif [ -z \"$1\" ]; then\r\n    echo \"Usage: $0 <length>\"\r\n    exit 1\r\nfi\r\n\r\n# Get the desired password length from the first argument\r\nPASSWORD_LENGTH=$1\r\n\r\n# Generate and print the random password\r\nrandom_password=$(generate_random_password \"$PASSWORD_LENGTH\")\r\necho \"Random Password: $random_password\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Step 2: Save and Exit\r\n- Save the changes and exit the text editor (in `nano`, you can do this by pressing `CTRL + X`, then `Y`, and `Enter`).\r\n\r\n### Step 3: Update the Alias\r\nIf you haven't already created an alias, you can do so now. If you have, you can keep it as is since it will work with the updated script.\r\n\r\n1. **Open your shell configuration file**:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   nano ~/.bashrc\r\n   ```\r\n   or for Zsh:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   nano ~/.zshrc\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. **Add or update the alias**: At the end of the file, add the following line:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   alias genpass='bash /path/to/your/generate_password.sh'\r\n   ```\r\n   Replace `/path/to/your/generate_password.sh` with the actual path to your script.\r\n\r\n3. **Save and exit**: Save the changes and exit the text editor.\r\n\r\n### Step 4: Reload the Configuration\r\nTo apply the changes, reload your shell configuration file:\r\n```bash\r\nsource ~/.bashrc\r\n```\r\nor for Zsh:\r\n```bash\r\nsource ~/.zshrc\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Step 5: Use the Alias\r\nNow you can generate a random password by specifying the length:\r\n```bash\r\ngenpass 16\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis command will generate a random password of 16 characters. You can replace `16` with any other number to generate passwords of different lengths. If you run the command without a length argument, it will display a usage message.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Can I generate a password by just clicking on the bash script?\r\n\r\nYes, you can modify the Bash script to generate a password without needing to pass a length argument from the command line. Instead, you can set a default password length within the script itself. This way, you can simply double-click the script to run it, and it will generate a password of the specified length.\r\n\r\n### Step 1: Modify the Script\r\n\r\n1. **Open your script**: Open your `generate_password.sh` file in a text editor:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   nano generate_password.sh\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. **Modify the script**: Update the script to set a default password length. Here’s the modified version of the script:\r\n\r\n--start of script--\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n#!/bin/bash\r\n\r\n# Function to generate a random password\r\ngenerate_random_password() {\r\n    local length=$1\r\n    # Define the character set\r\n    local charset='abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789!@#$%^&*()'\r\n    \r\n    # Generate the password\r\n    local password=$(cat /dev/urandom | tr -dc \"$charset\" | fold -s -w \"$length\" | head -n 1)\r\n    \r\n    echo \"$password\"\r\n}\r\n\r\n# Set a default password length\r\nDEFAULT_PASSWORD_LENGTH=16\r\n\r\n# Generate and print the random password\r\nrandom_password=$(generate_random_password \"$DEFAULT_PASSWORD_LENGTH\")\r\necho \"Random Password: $random_password\"\r\n\r\n# Pause the terminal (optional)\r\nread -p \"Press [Enter] key to exit...\"\r\n```\r\n--end of script--\r\n\r\n### Step 2: Save and Exit\r\n- Save the changes and exit the text editor (in `nano`, you can do this by pressing `CTRL + X`, then `Y`, and `Enter`).\r\n\r\n### Step 3: Make the Script Executable\r\nEnsure that the script is executable. You can do this by running:\r\n```bash\r\nchmod +x generate_password.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Step 4: Running the Script\r\nNow, you can run the script by double-clicking it, depending on your desktop environment. Here are a few ways to do this:\r\n\r\n- **Using a File Manager**: Navigate to the directory where your script is located, and double-click on `generate_password.sh`. If your file manager prompts you to run the script, choose that option.\r\n\r\n- **Using Terminal**: You can also run the script from the terminal by navigating to its directory and executing:\r\n  ```bash\r\n  ./generate_password.sh\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\n- If you double-click the script and it opens in a text editor instead of executing, you may need to adjust your file manager settings to allow executing scripts directly.\r\n- The script will generate a random password of 16 characters and display it in the terminal. The optional `read` command at the end will pause the terminal, allowing you to see the output before it closes. You can remove that line if you prefer the terminal to close immediately after displaying the password.",

It is a set of core tools inside Debian and Ubuntu Linux system. You can use the **apt command** to install, delete or remove apps, keep Ubuntu/Debian server up to date with security patches and more. Apt works with [dpkg](https://www.cyberciti.biz/howto/question/linux/dpkg-cheat-sheet.php) command cheat sheet for Debian and Ubuntu sysadmins to install and update the system. I strongly suggest that you use the apt command to save typing at the command line. This page provides apt command examples for new Linux users for package management purposes.  \r\n\r\n| apt command details | |\r\n--- | --- \r\n| Description | Advanced Package Tool \r\n| Category | Package Manager \r\n| Difficulty level | [Easy](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/tag/easy/ \"See all Easy Linux / Unix System Administrator Tutorials\") \r\n| Root privileges | [Yes](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/how-can-i-log-in-as-root/ \"See how to login as root user\") \r\n| Est. reading time | 10 minutes \r\n* * *\r\nIndex  \r\n1.

Conclusion  \r\n* * *\r\nThe [apt-get command](https://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/linux-debian-package-management-cheat-sheet.html \"Ubuntu/Debian Linux apt-get package management cheat sheet\") is the first front-end tool. apt is a second tool which overcomes some design mistakes of apt-get command. Hence you should use the apt command. This command provides nicer interface including progress bars and colors at the CLI. It provides the same functionality as the specialized APT tools, like apt-get and apt-cache, but enables options more suitable for interactive use by default.\r\n\r\n### apt command examples and purpose\r\n\r\n*Use apt for installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing apps/programs for a Debian or Ubuntu operating system in a consistent manner.*\r\n\r\n\r\n### Syntax\r\n\r\nThe basic syntax is as follows:\r\n\r\n`apt command`  \r\n`apt [options] command`  \r\n`apt [options] command pkg1`  \r\n`apt [options] command pkg1 pkg2`  \r\n\r\n### apt command examples\r\n\r\nLet us see how to use the apt command to install security updates or new set of packages on Ubuntu or Debian Linux server.\r\n\r\n### How to fetch updates\r\n\r\nTo download package information from all configured sources, enter:\r\n\r\n`sudo apt update`  \r\n\r\n### How to apply package and security updates\r\n\r\nTo upgrade all packages currently installed on the system, run:  \r\n\r\n`sudo apt upgrade`   \r\n\r\n*Please note that new packages will be installed if required to satisfy dependencies, but existing packages will never be removed.* \r\n\r\n### A note about applying package and security updates\r\n\r\nSimply type the following two commands to apply all security and package updates:\r\n\r\n`sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade`  \r\n\r\nSample output:  \r\n\r\n![gif](https://www.cyberciti.biz/media/new/images/faq/2016/02/lts-ubutnu-upgrade.gif)\r\n\r\nTo see the list of packages that can be upgraded on the system, enter:\r\n\r\n`apt list --upgradable`  \r\n\r\n![Fig.02: Ubuntu Linux 16.04 LTS list all upgradable packages apt command](https://www.cyberciti.biz/media/new/faq/2016/04/ubuntu-16.04-lts-list-upgradable-packages.jpg)\r\n\r\nFurther reading: [How to apply Debian security patches](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/how-does-debian-linux-apply-security-patches/)\r\n\r\n### How to perform full system upgrade\r\n\r\nThe full-upgrade command performs the function of upgrade but will remove currently installed packages if this is needed to upgrade the system as a whole. This is useful when packages are kept back from updates or you want to install from Ubuntu version 16.04 to 16.04.1:\r\n\r\n`sudo apt full-upgrade`\r\n\r\n### How to install a new packages\r\n\r\nTo install a new package called nginx, enter: \r\n\r\n`sudo apt install nginx`\r\n\r\n### How to remove a packages\r\n\r\nTo delete or remove a package called nginx, enter: \r\n\r\n`sudo apt remove nginx`  \r\n\r\nAll files are deleted except configuration files on the system.\r\n\r\n#### The purge option to remove both package and config files\r\n\r\nRemoving a package removes all packaged data, but leaves usually small (modified) user configuration files behind, in case the remove was an accident. Just issuing an installation request for the accidentally removed package will restore its function as before in that case. On the other hand you can get rid of these leftovers by calling purge even on already removed packages:  \r\n\r\n`sudo apt purge nginx`  \r\n`sudo apt purge nginx nginx-core nginx-common`   \r\n\r\n![apt command examples purging files](https://www.cyberciti.biz/media/new/faq/2016/04/apt-command-examples-purging-files.png)  \r\n\r\n#### The autoremove option\r\n\r\nThe autoremove option is used to remove packages that were automatically installed to satisfy dependencies for other packages and are now no longer needed as dependencies changed or the package(s) needing them were removed in the meantime. For example, when you upgrade Linux kernel to 4.1.5, you may not need Linux kernel version 3.8.5. \r\n\r\n`sudo apt autoremove`  \r\n`sudo apt --purge autoremove`  \r\n\r\n**Tip:** If you want to remove htop and install vim in one step, try:  \r\n\r\n`sudo apt remove htop vim+`  \r\n\r\nAnother way to do the same thing:  \r\n\r\n`sudo apt install htop- vim`  \r\n\r\nThe + (add) and - (remove) suffix to package names can override and flip an install/remove switch. It is a time and typing saving feature for the apt/apt-get\r\n\r\n### How to search packages\r\n\r\nThe search option can be used to search for the given regex.  \r\n\r\n`apt search php`  \r\n`apt search mysql-5.?`  \r\n`apt search mysql-server-5.?`  \r\n`apt search httpd* `  \r\n`apt search ^apache`   \r\n`apt search ^nginx`   \r\n`apt search ^nginx$`\r\n\r\n*Sample output:*  \r\n\r\n![Fig.01: Ubuntu Linux 16.04 LTS apt search package command](https://www.cyberciti.biz/media/new/faq/2016/04/ubuntu-16-04-lts-apt-search-package.jpg)  \r\n### How to find info about packages\r\n\r\nTo show or see information about the given package(s) including its dependencies, installation and download size, sources the package is available from, the description of the packages content and much more:  \r\n\r\n`apt show nginx`  \r\n`apt show sudo`  \r\n\r\n*Sample output:*\r\n\r\n```\r\nPackage: sudo\r\nVersion: 1.8.19p1-1\r\nPriority: optional\r\nSection: admin\r\nMaintainer: Bdale Garbee <bdale@gag.com>\r\nInstalled-Size: 3106 kB\r\nDepends: libaudit1 (&gt;= 1:2.2.1), libc6 (&gt;= 2.17), libpam0g (&gt;= 0.99.7.1), libselinux1 (&gt;= 1.32), libpam-modules, lsb-base\r\nConflicts: sudo-ldap\r\nReplaces: sudo-ldap\r\nHomepage: http://www.sudo.ws/\r\nTag: admin::login, admin::user-management, implemented-in::c,\r\n interface::commandline, role::program, scope::utility,\r\n security::authentication, use::login\r\nDownload-Size: 1054 kB\r\nAPT-Sources: http://httpredir.debian.org/debian stretch/main amd64 Packages\r\nDescription: Provide limited super user privileges to specific users\r\n Sudo is a program designed to allow a sysadmin to give limited root\r\n privileges to users and log root activity.

      "content": "## Linux partitioning tips\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo best install Linux, it is good practice to have a fair portion of the disk space devoted to the / partition to store the Linux files such as the /usr, /etc and the /usr/share folders. Then a larger /home partition to fit all of the user\\`s files in the home directory. This will work very well for a typical home user who wants to use Linux. Then, if a reinstall is requested, it could be possible to re-use the home directory and not overwrite it. That is most useful when a re-install of Linux is required. That makes switching a distro easier, if you can just re-use the home directory and install a new Linux distribution. Although Alma Linux is very good and has very few annoying quirks. This is a very solid Linux distribution using LVM for partitioning. This does work very well on a large drive such as a 1 terabyte SSD. This leaves a lot of space available for the user\\`s files. And plenty for installation of software.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is how my SSD is partitioned on my computer.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nsdb                                                                                                                   \r\n├─sdb1             vfat        FAT32                            7E1A-343A                               591.7M     1% /boot/efi\r\n├─sdb2             xfs                                          8468f575-02e2-4e7f-b186-bcb9cc75926a    615.6M    39% /boot\r\n└─sdb3             LVM2_member LVM2 001                         KIuLtx-XELv-7fIj-z6Kp-TGiZ-Aump-Von0oS                \r\n  ├─almalinux-swap swap        1                                37d2350b-bf03-400d-a096-93c819c7ab1c                  [SWAP]\r\n  ├─almalinux-home xfs                                          a7eb77c1-a723-4dab-9b4d-f7ea93e4432c    478.4G    44% /home\r\n  └─almalinux-root xfs                                          43d80849-2a61-4e27-8172-47dd6f0ccd3d     19.4G    72% /\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is a separate partition for /boot and then /dev/sdb3 is the LVM group containing the Linux filesystem with all of the associated files.

      "content": "To modify the script so that it accepts a length parameter, you need to make a few changes. Here’s how to do it step by step:\r\n\r\n### Step 1: Modify the Script\r\n\r\n1. **Open your script**: Open your `generate_password.sh` file in a text editor:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   nano generate_password.sh\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. **Modify the script**: Update the script to accept a command-line argument for the password length. Here’s the modified version of the script:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n#!/bin/bash\r\n\r\n# Function to generate a random password\r\ngenerate_random_password() {\r\n    local length=$1\r\n    # Define the character set\r\n    local charset='abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789!@#$%^&*()'\r\n    \r\n    # Generate the password\r\n    local password=$(cat /dev/urandom | tr -dc \"$charset\" | fold -s -w \"$length\" | head -n 1)\r\n    \r\n    echo \"$password\"\r\n}\r\n\r\n# Check if a length argument is provided\r\nif [ -z \"$1\" ]; then\r\n    echo \"Usage: $0 <length>\"\r\n    exit 1\r\nfi\r\n\r\n# Get the desired password length from the first argument\r\nPASSWORD_LENGTH=$1\r\n\r\n# Generate and print the random password\r\nrandom_password=$(generate_random_password \"$PASSWORD_LENGTH\")\r\necho \"Random Password: $random_password\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Step 2: Save and Exit\r\n- Save the changes and exit the text editor (in `nano`, you can do this by pressing `CTRL + X`, then `Y`, and `Enter`).\r\n\r\n### Step 3: Update the Alias\r\nIf you haven't already created an alias, you can do so now. If you have, you can keep it as is since it will work with the updated script.\r\n\r\n1. **Open your shell configuration file**:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   nano ~/.bashrc\r\n   ```\r\n   or for Zsh:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   nano ~/.zshrc\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. **Add or update the alias**: At the end of the file, add the following line:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   alias genpass='bash /path/to/your/generate_password.sh'\r\n   ```\r\n   Replace `/path/to/your/generate_password.sh` with the actual path to your script.\r\n\r\n3. **Save and exit**: Save the changes and exit the text editor.\r\n\r\n### Step 4: Reload the Configuration\r\nTo apply the changes, reload your shell configuration file:\r\n```bash\r\nsource ~/.bashrc\r\n```\r\nor for Zsh:\r\n```bash\r\nsource ~/.zshrc\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Step 5: Use the Alias\r\nNow you can generate a random password by specifying the length:\r\n```bash\r\ngenpass 16\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis command will generate a random password of 16 characters. You can replace `16` with any other number to generate passwords of different lengths. If you run the command without a length argument, it will display a usage message.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Can I generate a password by clicking on the bash script?\r\n\r\nYes, you can modify the Bash script to generate a password without needing to pass a length argument from the command line. Instead, you can set a default password length within the script itself. This way, you can simply double-click the script to run it, and it will generate a password of the specified length.\r\n\r\n### Step 1: Modify the Script\r\n\r\n1. **Open your script**: Open your `generate_password.sh` file in a text editor:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   nano generate_password.sh\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. **Modify the script**: Update the script to set a default password length. Here’s the modified version of the script:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n#!/bin/bash\r\n\r\n# Function to generate a random password\r\ngenerate_random_password() {\r\n    local length=$1\r\n    # Define the character set\r\n    local charset='abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789!@#$%^&*()'\r\n    \r\n    # Generate the password\r\n    local password=$(cat /dev/urandom | tr -dc \"$charset\" | fold -s -w \"$length\" | head -n 1)\r\n    \r\n    echo \"$password\"\r\n}\r\n\r\n# Set a default password length\r\nDEFAULT_PASSWORD_LENGTH=16\r\n\r\n# Generate and print the random password\r\nrandom_password=$(generate_random_password \"$DEFAULT_PASSWORD_LENGTH\")\r\necho \"Random Password: $random_password\"\r\n\r\n# Pause the terminal (optional)\r\nread -p \"Press [Enter] key to exit...\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Step 2: Save and Exit\r\n- Save the changes and exit the text editor (in `nano`, you can do this by pressing `CTRL + X`, then `Y`, and `Enter`).\r\n\r\n### Step 3: Make the Script Executable\r\nEnsure that the script is executable. You can do this by running:\r\n```bash\r\nchmod +x generate_password.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Step 4: Running the Script\r\nNow, you can run the script by double-clicking it, depending on your desktop environment. Here are a few ways to do this:\r\n\r\n- **Using a File Manager**: Navigate to the directory where your script is located, and double-click on `generate_password.sh`. If your file manager prompts you to run the script, choose that option.\r\n\r\n- **Using Terminal**: You can also run the script from the terminal by navigating to its directory and executing:\r\n  ```bash\r\n  ./generate_password.sh\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\n- If you double-click the script and it opens in a text editor instead of executing, you may need to adjust your file manager settings to allow executing scripts directly.\r\n- The script will generate a random password of 16 characters and display it in the terminal. The optional `read` command at the end will pause the terminal, allowing you to see the output before it closes. You can remove that line if you prefer the terminal to close immediately after displaying the password.",

      "content": "Ansible Copy Module | by cicube.io\r\n9–11 minutes\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\nWe'll examine Ansible, discussing its importance, and then focus on the Ansible copy module. Through examples, we'll demonstrate its typical usage scenarios.\r\nWhat is Ansible?\r\n\r\nAnsible is a powerful automation tool used in the field of IT for managing and orchestrating software applications, systems, and infrastructure. It enables users to automate various tasks such as configuration management, application deployment, cloud provisioning, and more.\r\n\r\nAt its core, Ansible operates based on a simple philosophy: automation should be easy to use, straightforward, and accessible to everyone. With Ansible, users can define their infrastructure and deployment procedures in a straightforward way using configuration files written in YAML format.\r\n\r\nOne of the key strengths of Ansible lies in its agentless architecture, which means that it doesn't require any additional software or daemons to be installed on the target systems. Instead, Ansible communicates with the remote servers and hosts hosts over SSH (Secure Shell) protocol, making it lightweight and easy to set up.\r\nWhat is Ansible Copy Module?\r\n\r\nThe Ansible Copy Module simplifies file distribution tasks and ensures consistency across target hosts by automating file transfers.\r\n\r\nIt's especially useful in situations where files need to be distributed across multiple servers or when specific files are needed for configuring applications.\r\n\r\nLet summarize it's concepts:\r\nFunctionality\r\n\r\n- This module allows copying files or directories from the local system (control machine) to remote hosts. - Provides flexibility in specifying source and destination paths. - Enables setting ownership and permissions for the copied files. - Handles symbolic links efficiently during the copying process.\r\nWhen to use Ansible Copy?\r\n\r\n- Distributing configuration files across multiple servers. - Automating distribution of configuration file, scripts, binaries, or any other files required for system configuration or application deployment. - Managing file distribution tasks as part of infrastructure automation\r\nAnsible copy module examples\r\nCopying Files from Local to Remote\r\n\r\nThe following is a basic example for copying a file from the local machine (where Ansible is executed) to remote hosts.\r\n\r\n- name: Copy a single file from local to remote\r\n hosts: target_hosts\r\n tasks:\r\n - name: Copy a file\r\n copy:\r\n src: /path/to/local/file.txt\r\n dest: /path/to/remote/location/file.txt\r\n\r\nA task is defined using the copy module, specifying the source file path with the src parameter and the destination location with the dest parameter. This allows for the copying of a single file.\r\nCopying Files and Directories from Local to Remote and Setting Permissions\r\n\r\nThis example extends the previous ones by including permissions while copying files and directories from the local machine to remote hosts. For files, the mode parameter is used to specify permissions (in octal format) for the copied file.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, for directories, permissions are set using the `mode` parameter.\r\n\r\n- name: Copy a file and directory from local to remote with permissions\r\n hosts: target_hosts\r\n tasks:\r\n - name: Copy a file with permissions\r\n copy:\r\n src: /path/to/local/file.txt\r\n dest: /path/to/remote/location/file.txt\r\n mode: '0644'\r\nname: Copy a directory with permissions\r\n copy:\r\n src: /path/to/local/directory\r\n dest: /path/to/remote/location/directory\r\n mode: '0755'\r\n recursive: yes\r\n\r\nThe `recursive: yes` parameter in the Ansible copy module is used when copying directories from a local machine to remote hosts. It indicates that the entire contents of the directory, including subdirectories and their files, should be copied recursively.\r\nHandling file backups for preventing data loss\r\n\r\nEnabling file backups with Ansible reduces the chance of accidentally losing or corrupting data while transferring files. It adds an extra level of security, giving users the option to keep existing files and go back to the previous version if necessary.\r\n\r\n- name: Copy a file with backup on remote hosts\r\n hosts: target_hosts\r\n tasks:\r\n - name: Copy a file with backup\r\n copy:\r\n src: /path/to/local/file.txt\r\n dest: /path/to/remote/location/file.txt\r\n backup: yes\r\n\r\nThe `backup` parameter is set to 'yes' to enable file backup during the copying process. When copying the file from the local machine to remote hosts, Ansible will create a backup of the existing file on the remote hosts, if it exists.\r\n\r\nThe backup file will have a suffix appended to its name, typically `.bak`, and will contain the content of the original backup file created before the copy operation.\r\nHow to move files within the remote machine with Ansible copy?\r\n\r\nTo move our files to remote locations within the remote machine using Ansible's copy module, we can copy the file to the new destination and then use the `remote_src: yes` parameter to delete the original file after the copy operation.\r\n\r\n- name: Move files within the remote machine\r\n hosts: target_hosts\r\n tasks:\r\n - name: Copy file to new destination\r\n copy:\r\n src: /path/to/source/file.txt\r\n dest: /path/to/new/destination/file.txt\r\n remote_src: yes\r\n - name: Remove original file\r\n file:\r\n path: /path/to/source/file.txt\r\n state: absent\r\n\r\nThis will first copy the file \"/path/to/source/file.txt\" to the new destination \"/path/to/new/destination/file.txt\". Then, it will use the \"file\" module to delete the original file \"/path/to/source/file.txt.\"\r\nHow to validate files before copying?\r\n\r\nThe validate parameter in Ansible's copy module allows you to specify a command that Ansible will run on the source file before copying it to the destination. This is useful for performing custom validation checks or transformations on the file before copying it.\r\n\r\n- name: Copy and validate a file\r\n hosts: target_hosts\r\n tasks:\r\n - name: Copy a file with validation\r\n copy:\r\n src: /path/to/source/file.txt\r\n dest: /path/to/destination/file.txt\r\n validate: '/bin/cat %s'\r\n\r\nThe `validate` parameter specifies the command `/bin/cat %s` that Ansible will run on the source file before copying it. In this case, we're using `/bin/cat` to simply read the contents of the file, but you can replace it with any other command that performs the any validation.\r\nHow to use Ansible Copy module with sudo permission?\r\n\r\nTo copy files with sudo permissions using Ansible's copy module, we can use the become parameter along with `become_user` and `become_method` options.\r\n\r\n- name: Copy files with sudo permissions\r\n hosts: target_hosts\r\n //highlight-next-line\r\n become: yes\r\n become_user: root\r\n tasks:\r\n - name: Copy file with sudo permissions\r\n copy:\r\n src: /path/to/local/file.txt\r\n dest: /path/to/remote/destination/file.txt\r\n remote_src: yes\r\n become: yes\r\n\r\n- The `become: yes` parameter allows the tasks in the playbook to execute with sudo permissions. - The `become_user: root` parameter specifies the user to become when executing the tasks with sudo permissions. In this case, we're becoming the root user. - The remote_src: yes parameter indicates that the source file is located remotely. - Additionally, `become: yes` is specified within the copy task to ensure that the copy operation itself is performed with sudo permissions.\r\nHow to Deploy Static Content with Ansible copy?\r\n\r\nTo deploy static content using Ansible's `copy` module, you can create a playbook that copies the static files from your local machine to the desired location on the target.\r\n\r\n- name: Deploy static content with Ansible copy\r\n hosts: target_hosts\r\n tasks:\r\n - name: Copy static files\r\n copy:\r\n src: /path/to/local/static_content\r\n dest: /var/www/html/\r\n recursive: yes\r\n\r\n- The `src` parameter specifies the path to the local directory containing the static content (`/path/to/local/static_content`). - The `dest` parameter specifies the destination directory on the target hosts where you want to deploy the static content (`/var/www/html/`). - The `recursive: yes` parameter ensures that all files and subdirectories within the source directory are copied recursively to the destination directory.\r\n\r\nThis is useful for scenarios such as deploying HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or other static files for a web application.\r\nAnsible's Role with Kubernetes, CI/CD, and Docker?\r\n\r\nAnsible has roles in managing infrastructure and automating deployment processes when working with technologies like Kubernetes, CI/CD, and Docker.\r\n\r\nInfrastructure Management: Ansible simplifies infrastructure management by allowing users to define server configurations and software installations in code. It's commonly used for setting up systems like Kubernetes clusters, ensuring consistency and reliability across environments.\r\n\r\nDeployment Automation: Ansible automates deployment tasks as part of CI/CD pipelines. It streamlines processes such as deploying Docker containers or updating Kubernetes clusters, ensuring smooth and consistent software delivery.\r\n\r\nIntegration and Coordination: Ansible facilitates integration and coordination between different tools and technologies. For example, it can seamlessly integrate with CI/CD tools to automate tasks like container building and deployment to Kubernetes. Additionally, Ansible helps ensure applications are deployed consistently across various environments (development, testing, production).",

      "content": "Mount Partitions/Volumes With UUID\r\n\r\nThis tutorial explains the concept of UUID in Linux and demonstrates how to update `/etc/fstab` using UUID to mount partitions or volumes in Ubuntu or other Linux distributions.\r\n\r\n### **What is UUID?**\r\nA **UUID** (Universally Unique Identifier) is a standardized identifier used in distributed systems to uniquely identify information without central coordination. It ensures unique identification of resources such as disk partitions and storage devices.\r\n\r\n### **Tutorial Details**\r\n- **Difficulty Level**: Easy  \r\n- **Root Privileges**: Required  \r\n- **Requirements**: Linux terminal  \r\n- **Category**: Disk Management  \r\n- **Compatible OS**: Most Linux distributions including Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, and CentOS  \r\n- **Estimated Reading Time**: 4 minutes  \r\n\r\n### **Benefits of Using UUID**\r\n- **Consistency**: UUID ensures that disks are correctly identified and mounted regardless of changes in hardware order.\r\n- **Efficiency**: Simplifies updates in `/etc/fstab` when moving storage between devices.\r\n- **Reliability**: Avoids system crashes caused by incorrect device naming.\r\n\r\n### **Steps to Mount Partitions Using UUID**\r\n\r\n#### **1. Find UUID of a Device**\r\nUse the `blkid` command to list block device attributes, including UUID:\r\n\r\n`sudo blkid /dev/sdb2`\r\n\r\n**Sample Output**:\r\n`/dev/sdb2: UUID=\"41c22818-fbad-4da6-8196-c816df0b7aa8\" TYPE=\"ext3\"`\r\n\r\nTo list all UUIDs:\r\n`sudo blkid`\r\n\r\n#### **2. Update `/etc/fstab`**\r\nEdit `/etc/fstab` to include the UUID for the partition:\r\n\r\n1. Open the file:\r\n   `sudo vim /etc/fstab`\r\n2. Add a new entry:\r\n   `UUID=41c22818-fbad-4da6-8196-c816df0b7aa8 /disk2p2 ext3 defaults,errors=remount-ro 0 1`\r\n3. Save and exit.\r\n\r\n#### **3. Mount the Partition**\r\nApply the changes immediately:\r\n`sudo mount -a`\r\n\r\nVerify the mounted partition:\r\n`mount | grep '/disk2p2'`\r\n\r\n### **Additional Commands**\r\n- **List Block Devices**:\r\n  `lsblk`\r\n  `lsblk --fs`\r\n- **Generate a New UUID** (if needed):\r\n  `uuidgen`\r\n  Apply it to a device:\r\n  `sudo tune2fs /dev/sdc1 -U <new-uuid>`\r\n\r\n### **Example `/etc/fstab`**\r\nHere’s a sample configuration:\r\n```\r\n# /etc/fstab: static file system information.\r\n#\r\nUUID=574c96bf-f2cb-49b8-9196-232a24047f94 /boot           ext4    defaults        0       2\r\nUUID=ADBC-2EA9  /boot/efi       vfat    umask=0077      0       1\r\nUUID=41c22818-fbad-4da6-8196-c816df0b7aa8 /disk2p2       ext3    defaults        0       1\r\n```\r\n\r\n### **Verification**\r\nUse the following commands to verify:\r\n- **Disk Space**:\r\n  `df -h`\r\n- **Mounted Partitions**:\r\n  `findmnt`\r\n  `findmnt /disk2p2`\r\n![image](https://www.cyberciti.biz/media/new/faq/2008/09/How-To-Use-UUID-To-Mount-Partitions-or-Volumes-Under-Ubuntu-Linux-548x599.png)\r\n\r\n### **Further Reading**\r\n- `man blkid`\r\n- `man fstab`\r\n- `man lsblk`\r\n- `man mount`\r\n\r\nBy following these steps, you can effectively use UUID to manage disk partitions in Linux, ensuring consistent and reliable system behavior.",

      "content": "A quick guide to writing scripts using the bash shell\r\nA simple shell script\r\nA shell script is little more than a list of commands that are run in sequence. Conventionally, a shellscript should start with a line such as the following:\r\n\r\n    #!/bin/bash\r\n\r\nTHis indicates that the script should be run in the bash shell regardless of which interactive shell the user has chosen. This is very important, since the syntax of different shells can vary greatly.\r\nA simple example\r\nHere's a very simple example of a shell script. It just runs a few simple commands\r\n\r\n    #!/bin/bash\r\n    echo \"hello, $USER. I wish to list some files of yours\"\r\n    echo \"listing files in the current directory, $PWD\"\r\n    ls  # list files\r\n\r\nFirstly, notice the comment on line 4. In a bash script, anything following a pound sign # (besides the shell name on the first line) is treated as a comment. ie the shell ignores it. It is there for the benifit of people reading the script.\r\n\r\n$USER and $PWD are variables. These are standard variables defined by the bash shell itself, they needn't be defined in the script. Note that the variables are expanded when the variable name is inside double quotes. Expanded is a very appropriate word: the shell basically sees the string $USER and replaces it with the variable's value then executes the command.\r\n\r\nWe continue the discussion on variables below ...\r\nVariables\r\nAny programming language needs variables. You define a variable as follows:\r\n\r\n    X=\"hello\"\r\n\r\nand refer to it as follows:\r\n\r\n    $X\r\n\r\nMore specifically, $X is used to denote the value of the variable X. Some things to take note of regarding semantics:\r\n\r\n    bash gets unhappy if you leave a space on either side of the = sign. For example, the following gives an error message:\r\n\r\n        X = hello\r\n\r\n    while I have quotes in my example, they are not always necessary. where you need quotes is when your variable names include spaces. For example,\r\n\r\n        X=hello world # error\r\n        X=\"hello world\" # OK \r\n\r\nThis is because the shell essentially sees the command line as a pile of commands and command arguments seperated by spaces. foo=baris considered a command. The problem with foo = bar is the shell sees the word foo seperated by spaces and interprets it as a command. Likewise, the problem with the command X=hello world is that the shell interprets X=hello as a command, and the word \"world\" does not make any sense (since the assignment command doesn't take arguments).\r\nSingle Quotes versus double quotes\r\n\r\nBasically, variable names are exapnded within double quotes, but not single quotes. If you do not need to refer to variables, single quotes are good to use as the results are more predictable.\r\n\r\nAn example\r\n\r\n    #!/bin/bash\r\n    echo -n '$USER=' # -n option stops echo from breaking the line\r\n    echo \"$USER\"\r\n    echo \"\\$USER=$USER\"  # this does the same thing as the first two lines\r\n\r\nThe output looks like this (assuming your username is elflord)\r\n\r\n    $USER=elflord\r\n\r\n    $USER=elflord\r\n\r\nso the double quotes still have a work around. Double quotes are more flexible, but less predictable. Given the choice between single quotes and double quotes, use single quotes.\r\nUsing Quotes to enclose your variables\r\n\r\nSometimes, it is a good idea to protect variable names in double quotes. This is usually the most important if your variables value either (a) contains spaces or (b) is the empty string. An example is as follows:\r\n\r\n    #!/bin/bash\r\n    X=\"\"\r\n    if [ -n $X ]; then \t# -n tests to see if the argument is non empty\r\n    \techo \"the variable X is not the empty string\"\r\n    fi\r\n\r\nThis script will give the following output:\r\n\r\n    the variable X is not the empty string\r\n\r\nWhy ? because the shell expands $X to the empty string. The expression [ -n ] returns true (since it is not provided with an argument). A better script would have been:\r\n\r\n    #!/bin/bash\r\n    X=\"\"\r\n    if [ -n \"$X\" ]; then \t# -n tests to see if the argument is non empty\r\n    \techo \"the variable X is not the empty string\"\r\n    fi\r\n\r\nIn this example, the expression expands to [ -n \"\" ] which returns false, since the string enclosed in inverted commas is clearly empty.\r\nVariable Expansion in action\r\nJust to convince you that the shell really does \"expand\" variables in the sense I mentioned before, here is an example:\r\n\r\n    #!/bin/bash\r\n    LS=\"ls\"\r\n    LS_FLAGS=\"-al\"\r\n\r\n    $LS $LS_FLAGS $HOME\r\n\r\nThis looks a little enigmatic. What happens with the last line is that it actually executes the command\r\n\r\n    ls -al /home/elflord\r\n\r\n(assuming that /home/elflord is your home directory). That is, the shell simply replaces the variables with their values, and then executes the command.\r\nUsing Braces to Protect Your Variables\r\nOK. Here's a potential problem situation. Suppose you want to echo the value of the variable X, followed immediately by the letters \"abc\". Question: how do you do this ? Let's have a try :\r\n\r\n    #!/bin/bash\r\n    X=ABC\r\n    echo \"$Xabc\"\r\n\r\nTHis gives no output. What went wrong ? The answer is that the shell thought that we were asking for the variable Xabc, which is uninitialised. The way to deal with this is to put braces around X to seperate it from the other characters. The following gives the desired result:\r\n\r\n    #!/bin/bash\r\n    X=ABC\r\n    echo \"${X}abc\"\r\n\r\nConditionals, if/then/elif\r\nSometimes, it's necessary to check for certain conditions. Does a string have 0 length ? does the file \"foo\" exist, and is it a symbolic link , or a real file ? Firstly, we use the if command to run a test. The syntax is as follows:\r\n\r\n    if condition\r\n    then\r\n    \tstatement1\r\n    \tstatement2\r\n    \t..........\r\n    fi\r\n\r\nSometimes, you may wish to specify an alternate action when the condition fails. Here's how it's done.\r\n\r\n    if condition\r\n    then\r\n    \tstatement1\r\n    \tstatement2\r\n    \t..........\r\n    else\r\n    \tstatement3\r\n    fi\r\n\r\nalternatively, it is possible to test for another condition if the first \"if\" fails. Note that any number of elifs can be added.\r\n\r\n    if condition1\r\n    then\r\n    \tstatement1\r\n    \tstatement2\r\n    \t..........\r\n    elif condition2\r\n    then\r\n    \tstatement3\r\n    \tstatement4\r\n    \t........    \r\n    elif condition3\r\n    then\r\n    \tstatement5\r\n    \tstatement6\r\n    \t........    \r\n\r\n\r\n    fi\r\n\r\nThe statements inside the block between if/elif and the next elif or fi are executed if the corresponding condition is true. Actually, any command can go in place of the conditions, and the block will be executed if and only if the command returns an exit status of 0 (in other words, if the command exits \"succesfully\" ). However, in the course of this document, we will be only interested in using \"test\" or \"[ ]\" to evaluate conditions.\r\nThe Test Command and Operators\r\nThe command used in conditionals nearly all the time is the test command. Test returns true or false (more accurately, exits with 0 or non zero status) depending respectively on whether the test is passed or failed. It works like this:\r\n\r\n    test operand1 operator operand2\r\n\r\nfor some tests, there need be only one operand (operand2) The test command is typically abbreviated in this form:\r\n\r\n    [ operand1 operator operand2 ]\r\n\r\nTo bring this discussion back down to earth, we give a few examples:\r\n\r\n    #!/bin/bash\r\n    X=3\r\n    Y=4\r\n    empty_string=\"\"\r\n    if [ $X -lt $Y ]\t# is $X less than $Y ? \r\n    then\r\n    \techo \"\\$X=${X}, which is smaller than \\$Y=${Y}\"\r\n    fi\r\n\r\n    if [ -n \"$empty_string\" ]; then\r\n    \techo \"empty string is non_empty\"\r\n    fi\r\n\r\n    if [ -e \"${HOME}/.fvwmrc\" ]; then \t\t\t# test to see if ~/.fvwmrc exists\r\n    \techo \"you have a .fvwmrc file\"\r\n    \tif [ -L \"${HOME}/.fvwmrc\" ]; then \t\t# is it a symlink ?  \r\n    \t\techo \"it's a symbolic link\r\n    \telif [ -f \"${HOME}/.fvwmrc\" ]; then \t# is it a regular file ?\r\n    \t\techo \"it's a regular file\"\r\n    \tfi\r\n    else\r\n    \techo \"you have no .fvwmrc file\"\r\n    fi\r\n\r\nSome pitfalls to be wary of\r\n\r\nThe test command needs to be in the form \"operand1<space>operator<space>operand2\" or operator<space>operand2 , in other words you really need these spaces, since the shell considers the first block containing no spaces to be either an operator (if it begins with a '-') or an operand (if it doesn't). So for example; this\r\n\r\n    if [ 1=2 ]; then \r\n    \techo \"hello\"\r\n    fi\r\n\r\ngives exactly the \"wrong\" output (ie it echos \"hello\", since it sees an operand but no operator.)\r\n\r\nAnother potential trap comes from not protecting variables in quotes. We have already given an example as to why you must wrap anything you wish to use for a -n test with quotes. However, there are a lot of good reasons for using quotes all the time, or almost all of the time. Failing to do this when you have variables expanded inside tests can result in very wierd bugs. Here's an example: For example,\r\n\r\n    #!/bin/bash\r\n    X=\"-n\"\r\n    Y=\"\"\r\n    if [ $X = $Y ] ; then\r\n    \techo \"X=Y\"\r\n    fi\r\n\r\nThis will give misleading output since the shell expands our expression to\r\n\r\n    [ -n = ]\r\n\r\nand the string \"=\" has non zero length.\r\nA brief summary of test operators\r\nHere's a quick list of test operators. It's by no means comprehensive, but its likely to be all you'll need to remember (if you need anything else, you can always check the bash manpage ... )\r\noperator\tproduces true if... \tnumber of operands\r\n-n\toperand non zero length\t1\r\n-z\toperand has zero length\t1\r\n-d\tthere exists a directory whose name is operand\t1\r\n-f\tthere exists a file whose name is operand\t1\r\n-eq\tthe operands are integers and they are equal\t2\r\n-neq\tthe opposite of -eq\t2\r\n=\tthe operands are equal (as strings)\t2\r\n!=\topposite of = \t2\r\n-lt\toperand1 is strictly less than operand2 (both operands should be integers)\t2\r\n-gt\toperand1 is strictly greater than operand2 (both operands should be integers)\t2\r\n-ge\toperand1 is greater than or equal to operand2 (both operands should be integers)\t2\r\n-le\toperand1 is less than or equal to operand2 (both operands should be integers)\t2\r\nLoops\r\nLoops are constructions that enable one to reiterate a procedure or perform the same procedure on several different items. There are the following kinds of loops available in bash\r\n\r\n    for loops\r\n    while loops\r\n\r\nFor loops\r\nThe syntax for the for loops is best demonstrated by example.\r\n\r\n    #!/bin/bash\r\n    for X in red green blue\r\n    do\r\n    \techo $X\r\n    done\r\n\r\nTHe for loop iterates the loop over the space seperated items. Note that if some of the items have embedded spaces, you need to protect them with quotes. Here's an example:\r\n\r\n    #!/bin/bash\r\n    colour1=\"red\"\r\n    colour2=\"light blue\"\r\n    colour3=\"dark green\"\r\n    for X in \"$colour1\" $colour2\" $colour3\"\r\n    do\r\n    \techo $X\r\n    done\r\n\r\nCan you guess what would happen if we left out the quotes in the for statement ? This indicates that variable names should be protected with quotes unless you are pretty sure that they do not contain any spaces.\r\nGlobbing in for loops\r\n\r\nThe shell expands a string containing a * to all filenames that \"match\". A filename matches if and only if it is identical to the match string after replacing the stars * with arbitrary strings. For example, the character \"*\" by itself expands to a space seperated list of all files in the working directory (excluding those that start with a dot \".\" ) So\r\n\r\n    echo *\r\n\r\nlists all the files and directories in the current directory.\r\n\r\n    echo *.jpg\r\n\r\nlists all the jpeg files.\r\n\r\n    echo ${HOME}/public_html/*.jpg\r\n\r\nlists all jpeg files in your public_html directory.\r\n\r\nAs it happens, this turns out to be very useful for performing operations on the files in a directory, especially used in conjunction with a for loop. For example:\r\n\r\n    #!/bin/bash\r\n    for X in *.html\r\n    do\r\n    \t\tgrep -L '<UL>' \"$X\"\r\n    done\r\n\r\nWhile Loops\r\n\r\nWhile loops iterate \"while\" a given condition is true. An example of this:\r\n\r\n    #!/bin/bash\r\n    X=0\r\n    while [ $X -le 20 ]\r\n    do\r\n    \techo $X\r\n    \tX=$((X+1))\r\n    done\r\n\r\nThis raises a natural question: why doesn't bash allow the C like for loops\r\n\r\n    for (X=1,X<10; X++)\r\n\r\nAs it happens, this is discouraged for a reason: bash is an interpreted language, and a rather slow one for that matter. For this reason, heavy iteration is discouraged.\r\nCommand Substitution\r\n\r\nCommand Substitution is a very handy feature of the bash shell. It enables you to take the output of a command and treat it as though it was written on the command line. For example, if you want to set the variable X to the output of a command, the way you do this is via command substitution.\r\n\r\nThere are two means of command substitution: brace expansion and backtick expansion.\r\n\r\nBrace expansion workls as follows: $(commands) expands to the output of commands This permits nesting, so commands can include brace expansions\r\n\r\nBacktick expansion expands `commands` to the output of commands\r\n\r\nAn example is given;:\r\n\r\n    #!/bin/bash\r\n    files=\"$(ls)\"\r\n    web_files=`ls public_html`\r\n    echo \"$files\"      # we need the quotes to preserve embedded newlines in $files\r\n    echo \"$web_files\"  # we need the quotes to preserve newlines \r\n    X=`expr 3 \\* 2 + 4` # expr evaluate arithmatic expressions. man expr for details.\r\n    echo \"$X\"\r\n\r\nThe advantage of the $() substitution method is almost self evident: it is very easy to nest. It is supported by most of the bourne shell varients (the POSIX shell or better is OK). However, the backtick substitution is slightly more readable, and is supported by even the most basic shells (any #!/bin/sh version is just fine)\r\n\r\nNote that if strings are not quote-protected in the above echo statement, new lines are replaced by spaces in the output.

use this command: `fc -e vi`.

      "content": "\r\nLinux partitioning tips.\r\n\r\nPosted 5 August 2024 by John Cartwright at 7:57 AM.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo best install Linux, it is good practice to have a fair portion of the disk space devoted to the / partition to store the Linux files such as the /usr, /etc and the /usr/share folders. Then a larger /home partition to fit all of the user`s files in the home directory. This will work very well for a typical home user who wants to use Linux. Then, if a reinstall is requested, it could be possible to re-use the home directory and not overwrite it. That is most useful when a re-install of Linux is required. That makes switching a distro easier, if you can just re-use the home directory and install a new Linux distribution. Although Alma Linux is very good and has very few annoying quirks. This is a very solid Linux distribution using LVM for partitioning. This does work very well on a large drive such as a 1 terabyte SSD. This leaves a lot of space available for the user`s files. And plenty for installation of software.\r\n\r\nThis is how my SSD is partitioned on my computer.\r\n\r\nsdb                                                                                                                   \r\n├─sdb1             vfat        FAT32                            7E1A-343A                               591.7M     1% /boot/efi\r\n├─sdb2             xfs                                          8468f575-02e2-4e7f-b186-bcb9cc75926a    615.6M    39% /boot\r\n└─sdb3             LVM2_member LVM2 001                         KIuLtx-XELv-7fIj-z6Kp-TGiZ-Aump-Von0oS                \r\n  ├─almalinux-swap swap        1                                37d2350b-bf03-400d-a096-93c819c7ab1c                  [SWAP]\r\n  ├─almalinux-home xfs                                          a7eb77c1-a723-4dab-9b4d-f7ea93e4432c    478.4G    44% /home\r\n  └─almalinux-root xfs                                          43d80849-2a61-4e27-8172-47dd6f0ccd3d     19.4G    72% /\r\n\r\nThere is a separate partition for /boot and then /dev/sdb3 is the LVM group containing the Linux filesystem with all of the associated files.

      "content": "Caterpillars come in all different shapes, colours and sizes, and none more so than moth caterpillars. Meet five of these cool critters and discover what makes them so special.\r\n\r\n###### Puss Moth\r\n\r\n![A Puss Moth caterpillar in defensive posture](https://butterfly-conservation.org/sites/default/files/inline-images/Puss%20Moth%20caterpillar%20-%20Pete%20Withers.jpg)\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar of the [Puss Moth](https://butterfly-conservation.org/moths/puss-moth), with its chunky green body, long twin-tails and large head, is more than just distinctive-looking – this cheeky caterpillar has a few tricks up its sleeve. When disturbed, the caterpillar will raise its head, which is marked with large eyespots to make it appear bigger than it is, and wave its tails, which have pinkish extendable protrusions (flagellae), as a warning to predators to back off. If that doesn’t work, they are capable of producing formic acid, which they squirt at the attacker from their mouth!\r\n\r\n###### Woolly Bear\r\n\r\n![Garden Tiger Moth Larva (Chris Atkin)](https://butterfly-conservation.org/sites/default/files/styles/srcset_medium/public/2022-05/garden_tiger_moth_larva_chris_atkin.jpg)\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar of the [Garden Tiger](https://butterfly-conservation.org/moths/garden-tiger) moth, also known as the Woolly Bear, is a large and very hairy caterpillar. It has a dense layer of short ginger and black hairs interspersed with long white hairs. But these hairs aren’t just for show, they are an important way to protect themselves as they cause irritation to any would-be predators looking for a snack. These hairs can also cause irritation to humans, so be careful not to handle them if you spot one.\r\n\r\n###### Elephant Hawk-moth\r\n\r\n![Elephant Hawk-moth (caterpillar) - Heath McDonald](https://butterfly-conservation.org/sites/default/files/styles/srcset_medium/public/2018-12/5391198844-elephant-hawkmoth-caterpillar-deilephila-elpenor.jpg?itok=MDUjyi2P)\r\n\r\nThe [Elephant Hawk-moth](https://butterfly-conservation.org/moths/elephant-hawk-moth) caterpillar is one of the largest and most recognisable caterpillars in the UK. It’s named for its elephant trunk-like appearance, and its distinctive markings give the illusion of having big eyes. When threatened, they can partly retract their head and make their body swell – this makes their eye spots more prominent so that they resemble a snake and can deter predators. Look out for them in August and September when they might be found roaming around in search of places to pupate.\r\n\r\n###### Early Thorn\r\n\r\n![Early Thorn (caterpillar) - Patrick Clement](https://butterfly-conservation.org/sites/default/files/styles/srcset_medium/public/2019-03/3950419088_d6d85a3c56_o.jpg?itok=4jE1oRp3)\r\n\r\nYou might be forgiven for not spotting this crafty caterpillar at first glance as its incredible disguise means that it can be hidden in plain sight. The [Early Thorn](https://butterfly-conservation.org/moths/early-thorn) caterpillar, with its mottled browns and knobbly protrusions, is camouflaged to look just like the twigs of native trees like Hawthorn, birch and hazel, which they feed on. So, if you spot a wriggly twig, make sure to give it a second look…\r\n\r\n###### Cinnabar\r\n\r\n![Cinnabar (caterpillar) - Koen Thonissen](https://butterfly-conservation.org/sites/default/files/styles/srcset_medium/public/2020-01/48241083172-tyria-jacobaeae-sint-jacobsvlinder.jpg?itok=f6YRqvIg)\r\n\r\nUnlike the Early Thorn, the caterpillars of the Cinnabar Moth are difficult to miss! Their vibrant yellow and black stripes are a warning to predators that they’re toxic and not to be eaten. They build up and store these toxins by eating their equally vibrant foodplant, Ragwort. The adult moths mimic this approach, using their bold black and red colours to suggest to predators that they should be left well alone.",

But he was a lovable rogue with a legion of fans\"\r\ntags:\r\n  - \"clippings\"\r\n---\r\nOur house is not the sprucest on our leafy, suburban street, and patches of grass and moss peek through the gravel outside. In summer, the garden blooms with untamed greenery that wraps around the walls and threatens to bring down the fence. We used to picture our well-to-do neighbours raising their eyebrows.\r\n\r\nBut Bernie was never embarrassed by our shabbiness, or his. He would squat in the middle of the driveway and defy anyone to judge his matted fur or ragged ears. With his stocky body and huge tomcat cheeks, he stood out in our neighbourhood of posh pedigrees. And for those other cats he was a terror, ruling the street with an iron paw. He had spent months as a stray, which had given him a streetwise, gritty swagger, despite his pathetic, squeaky attempts at an alleycat’s yowl.\r\n\r\nIt was easy to forgive his Clint Eastwood act as he sauntered home, playing up his injuries in the hope of a second or third dinner. All the more when he finished guzzling and clambered gracelessly on to the sofa in pursuit of some babying from our mum, then snored like a foghorn on her lap.\r\n\r\nWe fretted endlessly that his feline feuds would make us neighbourhood pariahs. Instead, he lent our home some of his ragged charm. When he went missing for a few days, we posted pictures of him on the neighbourhood app Nextdoor, only to discover a legion of local fans we had never known about.\r\n\r\nEveryone on the street, it seemed, could recall some buffoonery. He had fallen off walls chasing squirrels; crashed head-first into greenhouses; come home dyed bright green; taunted a dog so relentlessly that it had hurled itself through a Grade II-listed window to chase him off. And, displaying a remarkable awareness of the rewards of celebrity, he would saunter from catflap to catflap each night in search of dinner, like an emperor exacting tribute.\r\n\r\n![Bernie the cat looking grumpy](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9d8ccbf2402ce94204696db9d0ae03af7d7f3ef/365_106_1146_1244/master/1146.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)\r\n\r\nThe Clint Eastwood of cats … Bernie. Photograph: Courtesy of Antonia Langford\r\n\r\nWe were often in despair at his brazenness, but he helped us to feel better about our own scruffiness. If the neighbourhood could embrace his ragged charisma, perhaps there was hope for us, too.\r\n\r\nWe lost count of the times he defied death: all the sunny afternoons he lay in the middle of the road and stared down the cars racing up to the big houses on the hill; the huge dog he punched – properly punched, with paw clenched for a perfect right hook.\r\n\r\nLittle wonder it became unthinkable that Bernie would ever leave us. Even after the vet diagnosed cancer, we didn’t really believe time could be up for a cat who still pricked up his ears and rushed out to do battle every time he heard the hint of a rival’s miaow.\r\n\r\nThe receptionist at the vet’s office cried when she handed over his ashes.\r\n\r\nWe had adopted Bernie from a shelter in Northwich on Christmas Eve 2015, with a cat we were told was his brother, Jeremy. Yet when, recently, we went to reminisce over old pictures of our would-be adoptees, staring back we found two markedly thin-faced felines, tails intertwined and with a family resemblance that we had never seen in ours. No Bernie to be seen.\r\n\r\nWe never did find out what happened to Jeremy’s true sibling, but lucky us that by administrative error or sheer blind will, Bernie had muscled his way into our lives.\r\n\r\nIt was typical of our family chaos that we didn’t even notice we had been given the wrong cat. But then we wouldn’t have wanted it any other way. And nor would he.",

Installation Steps:\r\n    Install pipx (if not already installed).\r\n    Install linuxdir2html.\r\n    Reinstall (if needed).\r\n    Add pipx to your PATH.\r\n\r\n2. Command Usage Examples:\r\n    Basic usage:\r\n        linuxdir2html.py FolderName OutputFilename\r\n        linuxdir2html.py ~/home/lee/Downloads output\r\n    Or run with Python:\r\n        python3 ~/Path/To/linuxdir2html.py ~/Path/To/Directory OutputFilename\r\n\r\nThis will index the contents of /path/to/content/ and save the output as output.html in the current directory.\r\n\r\n3. Extra Options:\r\nYou can use the following optional flags:\r\n\r\n    --hidden: Include hidden files and directories.\r\n    --links: Create HTML links to the files.\r\n    --symlink: Follow symlinks (use with caution).\r\n    --silent: Suppress output (errors still shown).\r\n    --verbose: Show extra terminal output.\r\n\r\nNote a: Only use the --symlink flag if necessary.\r\nNote b: You can now use --startswith and --child parameters. For example:\r\n    linuxdir2html --startswith 'dev' --child 'Pictures' ~ ~/output\r\n\r\nThis will select directories starting with 'dev' and the 'Pictures' directory from your home directory. The --startswith filter only applies to the root search directory; all subdirectories and files will still be indexed. The --hidden flag can be used with --startswith.",

Many old woodworking tools from tag sales and garages have been sitting in drawers or damp boxes, accumulating surface grime and rust over decades of disuse or abuse. \r\n\r\nThis guide will explain how to remove rust from vintage hand tools in a cheap and easy way, without harsh chemicals or costly cleaning services.\r\n\r\n### Step 1: Use Vinegar and Salt to Eat Rust\r\n\r\n1. **Disassemble the Plane:** Completely disassemble the plane and hose it down to remove dust, dirt, and loose scale.\r\n2. **Prepare the Container:** Grab a plastic container deep enough to fully submerge the tool or its pieces. A take-out container works well for smaller tools like the old Stanley 220 block plane.\r\n3. **Submerge in Vinegar:** Fill the container with white vinegar until the tool is fully submerged.\r\n4. **Add Salt:** Sprinkle salt into the vinegar. The salt increases the acidity of the solution, helping to dissolve rust faster. Use one cup of salt per gallon of vinegar; for smaller amounts, two hefty tablespoons should suffice.\r\n5. **Let it Soak:** Allow the tool to sit in the solution for at least 12 hours. For best results, leave it for one to three days.\r\n\r\n### Step 2: Start Scrubbing\r\n\r\n1. **Remove the Tool:** After soaking, take the tool out of the solution.\r\n2. **Scrub Off Rust:** Use a 3M-style pad to scrub the tool. This type of pad won’t clog with sediment. For tough rust, a brass-bristled brush can be used.\r\n\r\n### Step 3: Neutralize the Acid with Baking Soda\r\n\r\n1. **Prepare Neutralizing Solution:** Place the tool back into the container and fill it with water.\r\n2. **Add Baking Soda:** Add two tablespoons of baking soda (or about one cup per gallon of water) and mix. This will neutralize the acidity and help loosen any remaining rust.\r\n\r\n### Step 4: Final Polish and Tune-Up\r\n\r\n1. **Scrub with Steel Wool:** After about 10 minutes, remove the pieces and scrub them with 0000 steel wool to bring out a nice sheen without removing the patina.\r\n2. **Wipe with Denatured Alcohol:** Use a rag soaked in denatured alcohol to remove any moisture, preventing future rust.\r\n3. **Apply Camellia Oil:** Finish by applying a light coat of camellia oil to protect against new rust.\r\n\r\nNow that your plane is clean, it’s time to set it up and start making shavings! For more information on tuning up your plane, refer to Roland Johnson's article in Fine Woodworking #216.\r\n\r\n### Additional Tips\r\n\r\n- **Aluminum Parts:** The vinegar and salt mixture can harm aluminum. If your plane has aluminum parts, limit their soak time to a few hours.\r\n- **Japanning Issues:** The black enamel coating (japanning) can be damaged. If extensive sections are missing, consider removing all japanning. Toluene can effectively remove stubborn enamel and can be applied with steel wool for a uniform finish.\r\n\r\n### Resources for Further Reading\r\n- Rollie Johnson - A Rust-free Winterized Woodshop\r\n- Lonnie Bird - Wax Keeps Rust Off Hand Tools\r\n- Matthew Teague - Buying Old Tools\r\n- Amy Costello - Rust Removal with Lemon Juice and Salt\r\n\r\n**Sign up for eletters today to get the latest techniques and how-to from Fine Woodworking, plus special offers!**",

El Vaquita (\"little male cow\") is one of several famous street dogs in the country, who frequently join demonstrations and protests [protest dogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot_dog) and instinctively side with them during confrontations with the police. During one clash, El Vaquita was shot by police with a riot shotgun and injured by a pellet. He would not allow himself to be captured, and had repeatedly refused to be adopted, so no one could take him to the vet. So instead, local people organised a fake demonstration, which he then joined, which led him voluntarily to the vets where his injuries were treated. In 2019, in a poll by the local newspaper El Diario, he was voted \"character of the year\", surpassing all of the humans. We have posters and other items commemorating other protest dogs Negro Matapacos and Loukanikos.\r\n\r\n- 1979: UK was sitting on a revenue bonanza from North Sea Oil, had a National Debt of just £80bn and owned all it's utilities, transport, infrastructure & millions of social homes.

I’ve only included ones here that aren’t commonly listed elsewhere.\r\n\r\n## But first, a word about Working Directories & Variables\r\n\r\n### Working Directory\r\n\r\nThe current working directory for the a custom action, is the folder the Thunar window that launched the action, is currently displaying. You can test this by creating and running the following custom action:\r\n\r\n#### Test CWD\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n\r\nPrints out the current working directory\r\n\r\nCommand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<span class=\"nb\">pwd</span> | zenity <span class=\"nt\">--text-info</span>\r\n```\r\n\r\nFile Pattern\r\n\r\n`*`\r\n\r\nAppears if selection contains\r\n\r\nDirectories\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n\r\n```\r\n<span class=\"nb\">sudo </span>apt-get <span class=\"nb\">install </span>zenity\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis means that you can use just filenames without a path in your custom actions to refer to a file in the current folder. This means that you can use the `%N` variable to process a list of selected files, instead if having to use the `%F` variable which includes the full pathname - this is handy for renaming just the files, without tampering with the pathname, for example.\r\n\r\n### Variables\r\n\r\nThunar custom actions can contain variable parameters, that get substituted with the actual value when you run the action. These allow you to refer to the files that are currently selected in Thunar when running your actions, without knowing in advance which ones. The following variables are available:\r\n\r\n| This… | is replaced at runtime with this… |\r\n| --- | --- |\r\n| %f | The path to the first selected file |\r\n| %F | The paths to all the selected files |\r\n| %d | Directory containing the file referred to by %f |\r\n| %D | Directories containing the files referred to by %F |\r\n| %n | The first selected filename, without the path |\r\n| %N | All the selected filenames, without paths |\r\n\r\nYou can see examples of these variables in use below.\r\n\r\n## My Thunar Custom Actions\r\n\r\nTo use these yourself, copy and paste these names, descriptions & commands into new actions in your Custom Actions Manager:\r\n\r\n### Share Folder\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n\r\nShares the currently selected folder, giving everyone

Install a media player\r\n2.  Download the installation script\r\n3.  Install the basic python system and **PyRadio** installation dependencies\r\n4.  Choose the type of **PyRadio** installation\r\n5.  Perform the installation\r\n\r\nIn order to decide which type of installation to perform, here are a couple of things you have to consider.\r\n\r\nThere are two installation types you can use for **PyRadio**:\r\n\r\n1.  **Fully isolated installation**  \r\n    This type of installation will install all **PyRadio** dependencies inside a virtual environment.  \r\n      \r\n    The advantage is that the system's python installation is not cluttered with the package's dependencies.  \r\n      \r\n    The disadvantage is that installing the dependencies in a virtual environment may fail.\r\n    \r\n2.  **System dependent installation**  \r\n    This type of installation requires that all **PyRadio** dependencies are installed outside the virtual environment used by **PyRadio**. All dependencies must be provided by the distribution (i.e. exist in the distribution repositories).\r\n    \r\n\r\n#### Install a media player\r\n\r\n[](https://github.com/coderholic/pyradio/blob/master/docs/linux-pipx.md#get-the-installation-script#install-a-media-player)\r\n\r\n**PyRadio** relies on the existence of at least one of the following media players: **mpv**, **mplayer** or **vlc**.\r\n\r\nPlease install at least one of them beforehand:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# on Debian\r\nsudo apt-get install [ mpv / mplayer / vlc ]\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Get the installation script\r\n\r\n[](https://github.com/coderholic/pyradio/blob/master/docs/linux-pipx.md#get-the-installation-script#get-the-installation-script)\r\n\r\nOpen a terminal and execute:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncd\r\nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coderholic/pyradio/master/pyradio/install.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nor using `curl`:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncd\r\ncurl -L \\\r\n    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coderholic/pyradio/master/pyradio/install.py \\\r\n    -o install.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease follow the instructions that match/suit your distribution.\r\n\r\n#### Debian and derivatives\r\n\r\n[](https://github.com/coderholic/pyradio/blob/master/docs/linux-pipx.md#get-the-installation-script#debian-and-derivatives)\r\n\r\n**Note:** The following instructions were tested on a freshly installed **Debian Testing**.\r\n\r\nInstall the requirements for the installation script:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo apt-get install \\\r\n    python3-full \\\r\n    python3-pip \\\r\n    python3-rich \\\r\n    python3-requests \\\r\n    python3-netifaces \\\r\n    libpython3-all-dev\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen install `pipx`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo apt-get install pipx\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf that fails, execute:\r\n\r\n```\r\npython3 -m pip install pipx\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, execute:\r\n\r\n```\r\npython3 -m pipx ensurepath\r\n```\r\n\r\nand exit the terminal.\r\n\r\n#### Fully isolated installation - Debian\r\n\r\n[](https://github.com/coderholic/pyradio/blob/master/docs/linux-pipx.md#get-the-installation-script#fully-isolated-installation---debian)\r\n\r\nOpen a terminal and execute:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncd\r\npython3 install.py -i\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### System dependent installation - Debian\r\n\r\n[](https://github.com/coderholic/pyradio/blob/master/docs/linux-pipx.md#get-the-installation-script#system-dependent-installation---debian)\r\n\r\nInstall dependencies:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo apt-get install \\\r\n    python3-dnspython \\\r\n    python3-psutil \\\r\n    python3-netifaces \\\r\n    python3-dateutil\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstall **PyRadio**:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncd\r\npython3 install.py\r\n```",

      "content": " - [ ] ### How to Disable IPv6 in linux?\r\n\r\nIn this article, we will discuss how to disable IPv6 in Linux. We can achieve this using sysctl.\r\n\r\n**What is IPv6?**\r\n\r\nIPv6 stands for internet protocol version 6, which is the latest version of the internet protocol.\r\n\r\n**What is the Internet protocol?**\r\n\r\nInternet Protocol (IP) is the protocol or set of rules by which data is sent from one computer to another on the internet. The Internet Protocol gives every computer, every machine, or computer on the internet a unique address called an IP address. The IP address is used to uniquely identify each device on a network. The IPv4 is the previous version of the Internet protocol.\r\n\r\nThe IPv4 is of size 32 bits, whereas the IPv6 is of size 128 bits. As the number of devices in the world is increasing rapidly, there is a chance that all the possible IPv4 addresses might get exhausted. so the ipv6 was introduced. \r\n\r\n**Disabling IPv6 in Linux**\r\n\r\nFor disabling the IPv6 we can use the sysctl command. The sysctl command is used to view and view the kernel settings, It is used to modify the kernel parameters at runtime. The IPv6 is disabled by modifying Kernel parameters with sysctl.\r\n\r\n**Approach**\r\n\r\n1\\. Firstly check if the IPv6 is enabled or not by following the command.\r\n\r\n```\r\n ip a\r\n```\r\n\r\n![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20220503181419/ip7-660x470.png)\r\n\r\nThe inet6 means IPV6 ( IPv6 is enabled)\r\n\r\n2\\.  Now use the following two commands to disable the IPv6\r\n\r\n> sudo sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.all.disable\\_ipv6=1\r\n> \r\n> sudo sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.default.disable\\_ipv6=1\r\n\r\n![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20220503181415/ip2-660x475.png)\r\n\r\n![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20220503181416/ip3-660x475.png)\r\n\r\n3\\. Again check if the IPv6 is disabled or not using **ip a** command\r\n\r\n![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20220503181417/ip4-660x472.png)\r\n\r\ninet6 is not available (IPv6 is disabled)\r\n\r\n**Enabling the IPv6**\r\n\r\n1\\. To re-enable the IPv6, the process is the same as above except that instead of 1 keep it as 0.\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=1\r\nsudo sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6=1\r\n```\r\n\r\n![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20220503181417/ip5-660x410.png)\r\n\r\n![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20220503181418/ip6-660x474.png)\r\n\r\n2\\. Check if IPv6 is enabled or not by using the IP command.\r\n\r\n![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20220503181414/1ip-660x473.png)\r\n\r\nIPv6 Enabled\r\n\r\n**Disable IPv6 using GRUB**\r\n\r\n1\\. Open the terminal and open the grub file in nano editor using the following command\r\n\r\n```\r\n sudo nano /etc/default/grub\r\n```\r\n\r\n![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20220505101627/l1.jpg)\r\n\r\n2\\. Change the above-highlighted lines as shown below\r\n\r\n> GRUB\\_CMDLINE\\_LINUX\\_DEFAULT=”ipv6.disable=1 quiet splash”\r\n> \r\n> GRUB\\_CMDLINE\\_LINUX=”ipv6.disable=1″\r\n\r\n![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20220505101627/l1.jpg)\r\n\r\n3\\. Save the changes using CTRL O, Exit using CTRL X.\r\n\r\n4\\. Update the grub using the following command.\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo update-grub\r\n```\r\n\r\n5\\. Check if the IPv6 is disabled using the IP a command.\r\n\r\n![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20220503181417/ip4-660x472.png)\r\n\r\n**Enabling IPv6**\r\n\r\nTo re-enable the ipv6 just undo the modifications made in the file\r\n\r\n> GRUB\\_CMDLINE\\_LINUX\\_DEFAULT=”quiet splash”\r\n> \r\n> GRUB\\_CMDLINE\\_LINUX=””\r\n\r\nSave the file and use the command **upgrade-grub**",

      "content": "#### check disk space using ncdu\r\n\r\nmore in depth help [here](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/focal/man1/ncdu.1.html)\r\n\r\nOnce installed, run Ncdu command without any options to analyze the disk space usage of your $HOME directory in your Linux box.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ncdu\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis command will analyze your HOME directory. After analyzing, it will show you disk usage report, sorted in descending order. Larger items will be displayed on top.\r\n\r\n**Sample output:**\r\n\r\n[![Check Disk Space Usage With Ncdu](https://ostechnix.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Check-Disk-Space-Usage-With-Ncdu.png \"Check Disk Space Usage With Ncdu\")](https://ostechnix.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Check-Disk-Space-Usage-With-Ncdu.png)\r\n\r\nCheck Disk Space Usage With Ncdu\r\n\r\nUse UP/DOWN arrows (Or **k** and **j** in the keyboard) to move between items.\r\n\r\nPress **\"i\"** to view the details of the selected item.\r\n\r\n[![Show Information About Selected Item](https://ostechnix.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Show-Information-About-Selected-Item.png \"Show Information About Selected Item\")](https://ostechnix.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Show-Information-About-Selected-Item.png)\r\n\r\nShow Information About Selected Item\r\n\r\nPress \"i\" again to close this window.\r\n\r\nTo view the items inside the selected directory, press **\"Right\"** arrow or **ENTER** key. It will display the list of files and directories inside the selected directory.\r\n\r\n[![View Items Inside A Directory](https://ostechnix.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/View-Items-Inside-A-Directory.png \"View Items Inside A Directory\")](https://ostechnix.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/View-Items-Inside-A-Directory.png)\r\n\r\nView Items Inside A Directory\r\n\r\nTo go back to the parent directory, press **\"Left\"** arrow.\r\n\r\n#### Display Directory Size\r\n\r\nAs I stated already, when we run Ncdu without any flags, it will show us the disk space usage of the HOME directory. We can also display size of a particular directory by specifying its actual path like below.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ncdu Downloads/\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo analyze entire root (/) file system, run:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ sudo ncdu -x /\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere, **\\-x** indicates that only count files and directories on the same filesystem as the directory being scanned. It will avoid scanning the mounted devices.\r\n\r\n#### Run Ncdu In Quiet Mode\r\n\r\nBy default, ncdu will update the output screen **10 times a second** while scanning the directory. This might consume more bandwidth if you are analyzing the disk usage of a remote system.\r\n\r\nFortunately, this will be decreased to once every 2 seconds in **quiet mode**. We can use this feature to save bandwidth over remote connections.\r\n\r\nTo run the ncdu in quiet mode, use **\\-q** flag as shown below.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ncdu -q\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Save Results In A File\r\n\r\nSome times, you might want to save the the scanning report and view it later. In such cases, scan a directory and export the results in any archive format for later viewing like below.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ncdu -1xo- / | gzip &gt;export.gz\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis command will scan the HOME directory and save the scanning report in a file called **export.gz**.\r\n\r\n**Sample output:**\r\n\r\n```\r\n/usr/lib/locale/zh_CN.gbk/LC_MESSAGES/SYS_LC_MESSAGES               188375 files\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can view it later by running the following command:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ zcat export.gz | ncdu -f-\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is also possible to export to a file and browse it once scanning is done:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ncdu -o- | tee export.file | ncdu -f-\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Analyze Disk Usage Of Remote Linux Systems\r\n\r\nTo scan a remote system, but browse through the files locally, run:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ssh -C ostechnix@192.168.1.60 ncdu -o- / | ncdu -f-\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere,\r\n\r\n*   **ostechnix** is the user name of my remote system.\r\n*   **192.168.1.60** is the remote system's IP address.\r\n*   **\\-C** switch enables compression.\r\n\r\nTo quit ncdu, press **q**.\r\n\r\n#### Ncdu Keybindings\r\n\r\nHere is the list of available key options in ncdu utility.\r\n\r\n*   **up**, **k**  - Move cursor up.\r\n*   **down**, **j**  - Move cursor down.\r\n*   **Right** arrow, **ENTER** key - Open selected directory.\r\n*   **Left** arrow, **<**, **h**  - Open parent directory.\r\n*   **n** - Sort by name (ascending/descending).\r\n*   **s** - Sort by size (ascending/descending).\r\n*   **C** - Sort by items (ascending/descending).\r\n*   **d** - Delete selected file or directory.\r\n*   **t** - Toggle dirs before files when sorting.\r\n*   **g** - Show percentage and/or graph.\r\n*   **a** - Toggle between apparent size and disk usage.\r\n*   **c** - Toggle display of child item counts.\r\n*   **e** - Show/hide hidden or excluded files.\r\n*   **i** - Show information about selected item.\r\n*   **r** - Recalculate the current directory.\r\n*   **b** - Spawn shell in current directory.\r\n*   **q** - Quit ncdu.\r\n\r\nFor more details, read the man pages.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ man ncdu\r\n```",

      "content": "**kill processes with xkill**\r\n\r\n*xkill is a command-line utility that can kill the undesired windows on the user’s screen*\r\n\r\n[more info](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-kill-processes-on-the-linux-desktop-with-xkill/)\r\n\r\n**using xkill**\r\n\r\ntype in terminal\r\n\r\n`xkill`   \r\n\r\nget a list of open windows\r\n\r\n`xlsclients`   \r\n\r\nexit without killing windows\r\n\r\n`ctrl+c`\r\n\r\n#### normal way of killing process\r\n\r\nGenerally, when we want to kill any process on the Linux system, we use the kill command. To kill a process first we should know the PID of the respective process. Then we provide this PID to the kill command as the argument. We can find the PID of a process using the following command:\r\n\r\n`ps -A | grep -i processName`\r\n\r\n![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20220612184729/Screenshotfrom20220612184654.png)\r\n\r\nTo kill the process, pass the PID to the kill command. For the above example:\r\n\r\n`kill 7507`\r\n\r\nThere is a more simple way than passing the PID of the process to kill command to kill the process. pkill is a command using which we can kill the process using the name of the process. For the above example, we can kill gvim with pkill using the following command:\r\n\r\n`pkill gvim`   \r\n\r\npkill is an awesome command, but it is preferred to use the kill command to know more about the killing process.\r\n\r\n#### using xkill without terminal\r\n\r\nIt is sounding weird to kill one process, we need to start another process. There is any way we can use xkill command without a terminal? yes, we can use xkill command without using the terminal. To access xkill command without using the terminal, we need to bind xkill command with the keyboard shortcut.\r\n\r\n#### add xkill cmd to a keyboard shortcut. \r\n\r\nName: xkill\r\ncommand: xkill \r\nthen set shortcut key\r\n\r\n\r\ntags: xkill, linux, linux_cmds, \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

More tips?](https://easylinuxtipsproject.blogspot.com/p/firefox.html#ID18)\r\n\r\n### Menu bar visible in Firefox\r\n\r\n1\\. Unfortunately, the menu bar of Firefox isn’t visible by default. Very annoying, but this is how you can fix that:\r\n\r\nFirefox menu button (with the three horizontal dashes on it, top right) - Customise… - bottom left: click on the button Toolbars - click on: Menu Bar\r\n\r\n### Make Firefox cleanse itself automatically upon quitting\r\n\r\n2\\. Improve your privacy: you can configure Firefox to cleanse itself automatically, upon quitting. All cookies and history are being deleted then. Furthermore, you can limit the tracking that some websites do to follow you.\r\n\r\nThe price you pay is a small decrease in user friendliness, but it’s not much. The privacy gain is huge, and outweighs this price by far.\r\n\r\nYou can do it like this:\r\n\r\nFirefox menu button (with the three horizontal dashes on it) - Settings - tab Privacy & Security\r\n\r\na. Item **Enhanced Tracking Protection**: leave those settings at their defaults, because otherwise some websites might function less well.\r\n\r\nYou’re going to set all cookies to be thrown away automatically upon closing Firefox (in the steps hereafter), so this tracking doesn’t impact your privacy by much anyway!\r\n\r\nb. Item **Website Privacy Preferences**: tick (enable):\r\n\r\nTell websites not to sell or share my data\r\n\r\nSend websites a “Do Not Track” request\r\n\r\nc. Item **Cookies and Site Data**: Tick the setting:\r\n\r\nDelete cookies and site data when Firefox is closed\r\n\r\nd. Item **History**: change the setting to:\r\n\r\n**Firefox will**: Use custom settings for history\r\n\r\ne. Now tick the following setting:\r\n\r\nClear history when Firefox closes\r\n\r\nf. Then, click the button Settings… (on the right of “Clear history when Firefox closes”) and tick everything, except for Site Preferences. Click OK.\r\n\r\ng. Item **Firefox Data Collection and Use**: disable (untick) everything you see there.\r\n\r\nh. Close the Settings tab and you’re done with optimizing the settings for privacy.\r\n\r\n***Tip:*** sometimes it may come in handy to force a cleansing *during* your web browsing. Simply by closing Firefox and launching it anew.\r\n\r\n### Limit the disk write actions of Firefox\r\n\r\n3\\. You can limit the disk write actions of Firefox, by putting the Firefox network cache into the RAM and by disabling sessionstore. Thus reducing its use of system resources. Like this:\r\n\r\n### Putting the Firefox network cache into the RAM\r\n\r\n3.1. By moving the Firefox network cache from your hard disk to the RAM, you diminish the amount of disk writes. This’ll probably make your Firefox noticeably faster as well. The price you pay is small: it’ll only “cost” you 512 MB of your RAM.\r\n\r\n***Note:*** Don’t do this when your computer has only 2 GB of RAM or less! Because with very little RAM, even 512 MB can’t be missed.\r\n\r\nProceed like this:\r\n\r\na. Type in the URL bar of Firefox:  \r\nabout:config  \r\nPress Enter.\r\n\r\nb. Now you’re being presented with a warning. Ignore it and click on the button “I accept the risk!”.\r\n\r\nc. [Copy/paste](https://easylinuxtipsproject.blogspot.com/p/copy-paste.html) the following into the filter bar (search bar):  \r\nbrowser.cache.disk.enable\r\n\r\nToggle its value to **false** by double-clicking it: this will disable “cache to disk” entirely.\r\n\r\nd. *(expired)*\r\n\r\ne. Then you’re going to determine how much memory can be used as RAM cache. [Copy/paste](https://easylinuxtipsproject.blogspot.com/p/copy-paste.html) this into the filter bar (search bar):  \r\nbrowser.cache.memory.capacity\r\n\r\nThe current **integer value** will probably be -1, which automates the maximum size of the RAM cache dependent on the available amount of RAM. So far so good, but this automation usually creates a cache that’s far too small…\r\n\r\nSo set it to 524288 (KB, which equals a maximum of 512 MB). That’s usually enough for all amounts of RAM. But if you have RAM to spare, I recommend 1048576, which equals a maximum of 1 GB.\r\n\r\nf. Close Firefox and launch it again. Then check it like this:\r\n\r\nType in the URL bar:  \r\n**about:cache**  \r\nPress Enter.\r\n\r\nBy the way: you’ll then also see a mention of an “appcache” which might still be present on the disk, but there’s absolutely no need to move that (much less frequently used) cache to the RAM as well.\r\n\r\n***Note:*** This is a user preference. Repeat this hack in each user account.\r\n\r\n### Disabling sessionstore\r\n\r\n3.2. Firefox has a session restore feature, which remembers what pages were opened if Firefox experiences an unexpected shutdown (read: crashes). This feature is neat, but causes many disk writes. Too many for an SSD. Disable it like this:\r\n\r\na. Type in the URL bar of Firefox:\r\n\r\nabout:config\r\n\r\nPress Enter.\r\n\r\nb. Now you’re being presented with a warning. Ignore it and click on the button “I accept the risk!”.\r\n\r\nc. Type in the filter bar: sessionstore\r\n\r\nc. Double-click on the item called **browser.sessionstore.interval**. The default interval is **15000**, which means 15 seconds. Add three zeros to the existing value, so that it becomes: **15000000** and click the OK button (note: adding too much zeros causes a malfunction! So add just three zeros.).\r\n\r\nd. Close Firefox and launch it again. Now you’ve practically disabled the session restore feature.\r\n\r\n***Note (1):*** Leave the other cache and sessionstore settings as they are: usually, the less invasive a hack is, the better. Because this reduces the risk of unexpected unwanted side effects.\r\n\r\n***Note (2):*** This is a user preference. Repeat this hack in each user account.\r\n\r\n### Disable spam by Web Push notifications\r\n\r\n4\\. Firefox contains a true “feature from hell” by default: Web Push notifications. These allow Firefox to deliver on-screen notifications from websites, even when those sites aren’t loaded. Time for some sarcasm: now what on earth could possibly go wrong with that?\r\n\r\nA website should ask for permission to do this abomination. But even then, it’s simply too easy to allow a website this misbehaviour. A mere wrong click and you could be in for a lot of notification spam…\r\n\r\nSo I advise to disable this horrible thing fully and permanently for all websites, like this:\r\n\r\na. Type in the URL bar of Firefox:\r\n\r\nabout:config\r\n\r\nPress Enter.\r\n\r\nb. Now you’re being presented with a warning. Ignore it and click on the blue button “I accept the risk!”.\r\n\r\nc. Type as search term: webnotif\r\n\r\nd. Double-click on **dom.webnotifications.enabled** which is currently set to the boolean value **true**, so that it changes into **false**.\r\n\r\n***Note (1):*** Leave the other webnotification settings as they are: usually, the less invasive a hack is, the better. Because this reduces the risk of unexpected unwanted side effects.\r\n\r\n***Note (2):*** this is a user preference. Repeat this hack in each user account.\r\n\r\n### Disable the memory of the URL bar\r\n\r\n5\\. The memory of the URL bar is more aggravating than useful, when you want to type a website address directly. An irritating busybody: “Maybe you want to type this?”. Thank heaven you can disable this annoyance like this:\r\n\r\na. Type in the URL bar of Firefox:\r\n\r\nabout:config\r\n\r\nPress Enter.\r\n\r\nb. Now you’re being presented with a warning. Ignore it and click on the blue button “I accept the risk!”.\r\n\r\nType in as search term: maxrich\r\n\r\nc. Double-click on **browser.urlbar.maxRichResults** and change the value to 0.\r\n\r\nd. Click on OK.\r\n\r\n***Note (1):*** Leave the other maxRichResults settings as they are: usually, the less invasive a hack is, the better. Because this reduces the risk of unexpected unwanted side effects.\r\n\r\n***Note (2):*** this is a user preference. Repeat this hack in each user account.\r\n\r\n### Some graphics cards: disable hardware acceleration in Firefox\r\n\r\n6\\. A few video cards have trouble because of the hardware acceleration that’s on by default in Firefox. On most hardware, this browser feature is useful and boosts performance.\r\n\r\nHowever, when you experience graphics problems in Firefox (delay when typing text, problems with displaying video’s), try if it helps when you disable it as follows:\r\n\r\nClick on the button with three horizontal dashes in the top right corner - Settings\r\n\r\nTab General: remove the tick for: Use recommended performance settings and then remove it for: Use hardware acceleration when available\r\n\r\nClose Firefox and launch it again.\r\n\r\n### Add-ons and extensions: don’t turn Firefox into a Christmas tree\r\n\r\n7\\. You can install a lot of add-ons (extensions) in Firefox. Some of those add-ons can be very useful.\r\n\r\nBut they have a couple of important disadvantages, because they are “applications within an application”:\r\n\r\n\\- they slow Firefox down, especially if there are a lot of them;  \r\n\\- they can cause malfunctions; both in each other and in Firefox itself;  \r\n\\- it has occurred: add-ons with malicious content. Don’t trust them blindly.\r\n\r\nSo don’t turn Firefox into a Christmas tree: don’t adorn Firefox with lots of add-ons. Limit yourself to only a few add-ons, that are really important for you.\r\n\r\nStrictly speaking, extensions and add-ons pollute the clean code of your browser. It’s wise to keep the level of pollution down to an absolute minimum.\r\n\r\n***Note:*** Watch out especially for add-ons that claim to make Firefox faster! Often they do more harm than good. Do not install them: even if one or two of them can really make Firefox run noticeably faster, they may damage the stability of your browser.\r\n\r\n### Test Firefox with a clean slate\r\n\r\n7.1. For troubleshooting purposes it can be useful to test Firefox with a clean slate. So with a default profile and with no other add-ons and extensions than the default ones.\r\n\r\nYou can do that as follows:\r\n\r\na. Launch a terminal window.  \r\n*(You can launch a terminal window like this: [\\*Click\\*](https://easylinuxtipsproject.blogspot.com/p/terminal.html))*\r\n\r\nb. Now disable your current Firefox profile by renaming it. For that, [copy/paste](https://easylinuxtipsproject.blogspot.com/p/copy-paste.html) the following line into the terminal:\r\n\r\nmv -v ~/.mozilla ~/.mozillabackup\r\n\r\nPress Enter.\r\n\r\nc. Close Firefox and launch it again. It should have a clean slate now.\r\n\r\nd. Do your testing.\r\n\r\n*When you’re done, you can restore the old profile like this:*\r\n\r\n*e. First remove the newly created profile folder, with this terminal command (use copy/paste):  \r\nrm -v -r ~/.mozilla*\r\n\r\n*f. Then restore the old profile with this terminal command (use copy/paste):  \r\nmv -v ~/.mozillabackup ~/.mozilla*\r\n\r\n*g. Close Firefox and launch it again. All should be, as it was before.*\r\n\r\n### Run Firefox from within a secure sandbox\r\n\r\n8\\. You can increase the security of Firefox greatly, when you run it from within a secure sandbox. This neat solution causes almost no loss of user-friendliness and only causes a little extra system load, while making Firefox much more secure.\r\n\r\nYou can achieve that by [applying this how-to](https://easylinuxtipsproject.blogspot.com/p/sandbox.html).\r\n\r\n### Enable rendering of DRM content\r\n\r\n9\\. Digital Rights Management (DRM) is a nasty phenomenon, because it limits your usage options. But unfortunately it’s a fact of life that some web content has been contaminated with it, so we have to deal with it…\r\n\r\nYou can enable playback of DRM content in Firefox like this:\r\n\r\nFirefox menu button (with the three horizontal dashes on it) - Settings - tab General - Digital Rights Management (DRM) Content: tick Play DRM-controlled content\r\n\r\n### Lost localization in Firefox?\r\n\r\n10\\. When you have a non-English Firefox, updates might undo its localization so that it turns fully English. This is how to fix that:\r\n\r\na. In the address bar of Firefox, type:\r\n\r\nabout:config\r\n\r\nPress Enter and then click to accept the risk.\r\n\r\nb. Then \\*\\*\\*right-\\*\\*\\*click anywhere on that page - New - String\r\n\r\nc. Give the new string this name:\r\n\r\nintl.locale.requested\r\n\r\nLeave the value empty; this forces Firefox to follow the system locale.\r\n\r\nd. Click OK.\r\n\r\ne. Close Firefox and restart it.\r\n\r\n### Letters too small on web pages? Increase the font size\r\n\r\n11\\. You can enlarge the displayed font size like this:\r\n\r\nPress the Ctrl key and keep it pressed (don’t release it). Now hit the plus key ( + ) for as many times as you wish, until the font size that you want is achieved. Minimize: keep the Ctrl key pressed and hit the minus key ( - ). Back to default: keep the Ctrl key pressed and hit the zero key ( 0 ).\r\n\r\nThis however enlarges both text and images. That often renders images ugly. Set the enlargement therefore to “Zoom Text Only”. Like this:\r\n\r\nFirst make the Firefox menu bar visible:  \r\nFirefox panel - ***right-click*** on the right of the green plus sign - tick:  \r\nMenu Bar\r\n\r\nIn the menu bar (first make it visible as described in item 1 on this page): View - Zoom - tick: Zoom Text Only.\r\n\r\n***Note:*** Even if you see no tick box, you can place that tick nevertheless!\r\n\r\nOn laptops with small displays you can also use one of the nifty add-ons for setting the default zoom level. You can install one in Firefox like this: Firefox menu button (with the three dashes on it) - Add-ons - Get Add-ons.\r\n\r\n***Note:*** Be very reluctant to install add-ons in Firefox: the more add-ons it contains, the slower Firefox becomes.\r\n\r\n### Optimize the Places database from time to time\r\n\r\n12\\. In your Firefox profile there’s an sqlite database called Places, which after a while starts resembling a swollen Swiss cheese with holes. That might slow your Firefox down.\r\n\r\nYou can speed your Firefox up a bit, by optimizing (vacuuming) that database: you can namely deflate that swollen Swiss cheese into a compact smaller cheese. As follows:\r\n\r\nType the following ***in the URL bar*** of Firefox:\r\n\r\nabout:support\r\n\r\nPress Enter.\r\n\r\nAlmost at the bottom of the page you get to see then, there’s a header called Places Database. Click there on the button called Verify Integrity.\r\n\r\nYou’re done! Repeat this on a monthly basis, so that your Firefox won’t lose speed again because of a swollen database.\r\n\r\n### Stop Firefox from automatically playing videos\r\n\r\n13\\. It can drive a man crazy: videos that start playing automatically on web pages. Why, for heaven’s sake, did someone at Mozilla think it’s a good idea to enable that horribly invasive feature by default?\r\n\r\nThankfully there’s this solution:\r\n\r\nFirefox menu button (with the three horizontal dashes on it) - Settings - tab Privacy & Security - section Permissions:  \r\nAutoplay: click on the button Settings… - Default for all websites: set that to Block Audio and Video - click on the button Save changes.\r\n\r\n### Make new tab pages empty\r\n\r\n14\\. By default, when you open a new tab page, Firefox shows tiles of websites that you’ve previously visited. If you prefer those new tabs to show an empty page instead, you can do that as follows:\r\n\r\nIn the new tab, click the gear icon in the top right of the new tab - remove all checks except the one for Search.\r\n\r\n### Want to get rid of polluted settings in Firefox?\r\n\r\n15\\. Do you have polluted settings in Firefox (possibly because of shady add-ons), and do you wish to start anew with a clean browser? Then proceed like described in item 7.1 on this web page.\r\n\r\n### Change the search engine of the Firefox search bar into Google or Startpage\r\n\r\n16\\. Linux Mint has set Yahoo as default search engine for the search bar of Firefox. That’s not ideal: most people prefer Google or the privacy-respecting [Startpage](https://www.startpage.com/) (which yields Google results without invading your privacy).\r\n\r\nMint has made it rather difficult to change Yahoo into Google or Startpage (sigh…), but [this is how you can still do that](https://easylinuxtipsproject.blogspot.com/p/firefox-search.html).\r\n\r\n### Temporary relief: force Firefox to minimize its memory usage\r\n\r\n17\\. Firefox bogging down your system? Then you can provide temporary relief by forcing Firefox to minimize its memory usage, like this:\r\n\r\nType in the URL bar of Firefox:  \r\nabout:memory\r\n\r\nPress Enter. Tab Free memory: click the button called Minimize memory usage\r\n\r\nThis offers only temporary relief; for a structural solution you’ll need to investigate a bit more. Start with the usual suspects: the add-ons and extensions that you’ve weighed your Firefox down with.",

Just hold down your chosen compose key, then press the other keys in turn: \\[compose key\\] + e + = gets you a Euro symbol.\r\n\r\nThe compose key on Linux is _incredibly_ useful, but not configured by default - and on XFCE there’s currently no graphical UI to change it. However, it’s pretty simple to change… here’s how to make the Caps Lock key your compose key:\r\n\r\nIn the file `/etc/default/keyboard`, change `XKBOPTIONS` to look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<span class=\"py\">XKBOPTIONS</span><span class=\"p\">=</span><span class=\"s\">\"compose:caps\"</span>\r\n```\r\n\r\nSave the file. You can now either reboot, restart X, or see [Activating your change without rebooting](https://duncanlock.net/blog/2013/05/03/how-to-set-your-compose-key-on-xfce-xubuntu-lxde-linux//#_activating_your_change_without_rebooting), below.\r\n\r\nIf you don’t want to use Caps Lock as your compose key, there are some other options to choose from in this file: `/usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/xorg.lst` - search for ‘compose’, they’re listed towards the end. Mine currently looks like this:\r\n\r\n| Setting | Compose Key |\r\n| --- | --- |\r\n| compose:ralt | Right Alt |\r\n| compose:lwin | Left Win |\r\n| compose:rwin | Right Win |\r\n| compose:menu | Menu |\r\n| compose:lctrl | Left Ctrl |\r\n| compose:rctrl | Right Ctrl |\r\n| compose:caps | Caps Lock |\r\n| compose:102 | <Less/Greater> |\r\n| compose:paus | Pause |\r\n| compose:prsc | PrtSc |\r\n| compose:sclk | Scroll Lock |\r\n\r\n## Using the Compose Key\r\n\r\nTry holding down the Caps Lock key and type the letter `l`, followed by a dash you should get a British Pound symbol: £ - magic!\r\n\r\nGenerally you can just hold down your compose key then type a combo that kinda ‘looks like’ the symbol you want, if they were drawn on top of each other. For example, `e` followed by `=` will get you a Euro symbol: €, `o` followed by `c` will get you a copyright symbol: © - and `1` followed by `2` gets you a half fraction: ½.\r\n\r\nThese work anywhere you can type things. There’s a list of some common ones [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compose_key#Common_compose_combinations), and a [full list here](http://www.hermit.org/Linux/ComposeKeys.html).\r\n\r\n## Activating your change without rebooting\r\n\r\n### Option One\r\n\r\nOnce you’ve changed your permanent setup by changing `/etc/default/keyboard`, you can set your current session using `setxkbmap`, like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<span class=\"gp\">$</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>setxkbmap <span class=\"nt\">-option</span> compose:caps\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt uses the same names for keys as above. It’s also possible to leave `/etc/default/keyboard` alone and add this command to your `~/.xinit`, `~/.xsession` or the XFCE autostart commands instead. If you do that, it’ll only apply to your login, not system wide though.\r\n\r\n### Option Two\r\n\r\nThis was the first method that I discovered and isn’t a simple as Option One, but if that doesn’t work for some reason, this should. Like it says at the top of `/etc/default/keyboard`, check `/usr/share/doc/keyboard-configuration/README.Debian` for what to do after you’ve modified it. Mine currently says:\r\n\r\n> After modifying `/etc/default/keyboard`, you can apply the changes to the Linux console by running `setupcon`. If X is configured to use that file too, then the changes will become visible to X only if\r\n> \r\n> `udevadm trigger --subsystem-match=input --action=change`\r\n> \r\n> is called, or the system is rebooted.\r\n\r\nWhen it says Console, it means it – not a terminal window, an actual login console – try pressing `Ctrl + Alt + F1` and logging in, then running:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<span class=\"gp\">$</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>setupcon\r\n<span class=\"gp\">$</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>udevadm trigger <span class=\"nt\">--subsystem-match</span><span class=\"o\">=</span>input <span class=\"nt\">--action</span><span class=\"o\">=</span>change\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese don’t print anything out when they run, disconcertingly. Once you’ve run them in the Console, `Ctrl + Alt + F7` should get you back to the default console session you were in before.",

However, you can choose a different name using the -O option:\r\n\r\nwget -O newfilename.zip http://example.com/file.zip    \r\nLimiting download speed\r\nSometimes, I don’t want Wget to consume all my bandwidth. Limiting the download speed is helpful in such cases:\r\n\r\nwget --limit-rate=200k http://example.com/file.zip\r\nThis command will limit the download speed to 200 KB/s.\r\n\r\nResuming interrupted downloads\r\nThis is my absolute favorite feature of Wget. If a download is interrupted, simply use the -c option to resume:\r\n\r\nwget -c http://example.com/file.zip\r\nSample Output:\r\n\r\nHTTP request sent, awaiting response... 206 Partial Content\r\nLength: 1234567 (1.2M), 567890 bytes remaining [application/zip]\r\nSaving to: 'file.zip'\r\nDownloading multiple files\r\nWget can also download multiple files listed in a text file. I find this super handy when dealing with batches of files.\r\n\r\nwget -i list_of_files.txt\r\nlist_of_files.txt should contain one URL per line.\r\n\r\nRecursive downloads and website mirroring\r\nThere are times when I need to download entire websites. Wget has got me covered with its recursive downloading capability.\r\n\r\nwget --recursive --no-clobber --no-parent http://example.com/directory/\r\nThis command will download all files from the specified directory without overwriting existing files (--no-clobber) and will not venture outside the directory (--no-parent).\r\n\r\nHandling slow or unreliable connections\r\nWe’ve all been there, cursing at slow or unstable internet connections. Wget’s retry option has saved my sanity on numerous occasions:\r\n\r\nwget --tries=10 http://example.com/file.zip\r\nWget will retry the download 10 times before giving up.\r\n\r\n**Advanced Wget features**\r\nQuiet mode\r\nSometimes, I don’t need the detailed output. In such cases, Wget’s quiet mode, indicated by -q, is a blessing:\r\n\r\nwget -q http://example.com/file.zip\r\nWith this, Wget suppresses all its output, making for a clean terminal experience.\r\n\r\n**Authentication for restricted downloads**\r\nOften, files or directories are password protected. Wget effortlessly handles this using the --user and --password options:\r\n\r\nwget --user=username --password=password http://example.com/protectedfile.zip\r\nFor security reasons, I’d suggest not entering the password directly in the command (as it can be seen in the command history). Instead, use --ask-password:\r\n\r\nwget --user=username --ask-password http://example.com/protectedfile.zip\r\nWget will then prompt you to enter the password, keeping it hidden from prying eyes.\r\n\r\n| Command/Option | Description |\r\n| --- | --- |\r\n| `wget http://example.com/file.zip` | Basic file download |\r\n| `wget -q http://example.com/file.zip` | Download in quiet mode |\r\n| `wget --user=username --password=password ...` | Authenticate during download |\r\n| `wget --user=username --ask-password ...` | Authenticate with prompt for password |\r\n| `wget -O myfilename.zip http://example.com...` | Specify output filename |\r\n| `wget --limit-rate=200k http://example.com...` | Limit download speed to 200 KB/s |\r\n| `wget -c http://example.com/file.zip` | Resume interrupted downloads |\r\n| `wget --no-check-certificate http://...` | Ignore SSL certificate checks |\r\n| `wget -b http://example.com/file.zip` | Run Wget in the background |\r\n| `wget ftp://username:password@ftp.example.com...` | Download files from FTP with credentials |    \r\n\r\n>\r\n\r\ntags:\r\n#wget #cmd-line-tools #linux #cmds #how-to",

      "content": "**Improve battery life with TLP**\r\n\r\n\r\nTLP is a free, open-source and feature rich utility for battery use optimization on laptops running Debian and other Linux distros. You can find it in both CLI and GUI versions for whatever suits you. TLP comes with a default configuration which is pretty much perfectly tuned for your OS and the underlying machine. All you need to do is to install and enable the utility and you are good to go. The utility works by optimizing the power used by hardware devices while your laptop is running on its battery rather than on AC.\r\n\r\nIn this article, we will explain how to enable TLP on your Debian machine in order to save battery power through:\r\n\r\n*   TLP Command Line Interface\r\n*   TLP User Interface Utility\r\n\r\nWe have run the commands and procedures mentioned in this article on a Debian Buster 10 system.\r\n\r\n**Install and use the TLP CLI**\r\n\r\nOpen your Debian command line, the Terminal, easily through the system Application Launcher search. Press the Super/Windows key and you can search for Terminal in the search bar as follows:\r\n\r\n![Open Debian Terminal](https://vitux.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/word-image-60.png)\r\n\r\nThe next step is to update your system’s repository index through the following command:\r\n\r\n`sudo apt-get update`\r\n\r\nThis helps you in installing the latest available version of a software from the Internet.\r\n\r\n![Update Package lists](https://vitux.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/word-image-61.png)\r\n\r\nPlease note that only an authorized user can add, remove, and configure software on Debian. Please enter the following apt-get command as sudo or root user in order to install TLP on your system:\r\n\r\n`sudo apt-get install tlp`\r\n\r\n![Install TLP](https://vitux.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/word-image-62.png)\r\n\r\nThe system might prompt you with a y/n option to continue installation. Please enter Y if you want to continue with the installation. The process might take some time, depending on your Internet speed, after which TLP will be installed on your system.\r\n\r\nYou are now ready to use TLP. Let us first see how to start the utility through the following command; the command starts the TLP service on your system:\r\n\r\n`sudo tlp start`\r\n\r\n![Start tlp](https://vitux.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/word-image-63.png)\r\n\r\nYou following TLP command lets you view detailed system information and also the status of the TLP utility:\r\n\r\n`sudo tlp-stat -s`\r\n\r\n![Get TLP status](https://vitux.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/word-image-64.png)\r\n\r\nTLP, by default, starts in a preset configuration that is pretty much best suited for your operating system and hardware. You can view this configuration through the following command:\r\n\r\n`sudo tlp-stat -c`\r\n\r\n![Get TLP configuration](https://vitux.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/word-image-65.png)\r\n\r\nAnother very useful command is to print the detailed battery report through TLP. Use the b flag with the tlp-stat command to view this information:\r\n\r\n`sudo tlp-stat -b`\r\n\r\n![Get detailed notebook battery report using TLP](https://vitux.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/word-image-66.png)\r\n\r\nIf you ever feel like removing this utility from your system, you can do so through the following command as sudo:\r\n\r\n`sudo apt-get remove tlp`\r\n\r\n![Remove tlp](https://vitux.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/word-image-67.png)\r\n\r\nEnter y on the y/n prompt and the software will be completely removed from your system.\r\n\r\n**Install and Use the TLP UI**\r\n\r\nFor a person who is more into the UI, there is a user interface available for the TLP utility. Let us learn how to install it through the command line by using the deb package from github.\r\n\r\nNote: Before installing the TLP UI, please make sure that the TLP utility is already installed and running on your system.\r\n\r\nThese are some prerequisites that you will need in order to clone and then build the deb package (that we are going to download next through git):\r\n\r\n`sudo apt-get install python3-gi git python3-setuptools python3-stdeb`\r\n\r\n![Install Python](https://vitux.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/word-image-68.png)\r\n\r\nThen, using the git command, download the TLPUI package from github as follows:\r\n\r\n`git clone https://github.com/d4nj1/TLPUI`\r\n\r\n![Get TLP source from GitHub](https://vitux.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/word-image-69.png)\r\n\r\nNext, move to the download TLPUI directory and build the deb package as follows:\r\n\r\n`python3 setup.py --command-packages=stdeb.command bdist_deb`\r\n\r\n![Setup TLP](https://vitux.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/word-image-70.png)\r\n\r\nThe last step is to install the deb package through dpkg as follows:\r\n\r\n`sudo dpkg -i deb_dist/python3-tlpui_*all.deb`\r\n\r\n![Install TLP Debian packages](https://vitux.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/word-image-71.png)\r\n\r\nThe process might take some time, depending on your Internet speed, after which the TLP UI will be installed on your system.\r\n\r\nYou are now ready to launch and use the utility. Enter the following command in the Terminal.\r\n\r\n`tlpui`\r\n\r\n![Start TLP UI](https://vitux.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/word-image-72.png)\r\n\r\nThis is how the TLP UI looks like. The Configuration tab lets you view and edit the TLP settings. Whereas, the Statistics tab lets you view system and battery use statistics.\r\n\r\n![TLP UI](https://vitux.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/word-image-73.png)\r\n\r\nThe most important button here is the TLP-ENABLE slider On and Off button. Through this button, you can enable/disable battery optimization through TLP, based on your configuration. Please make sure to save the changes to the TLP configuration file by using the Save option from the File menu.\r\n\r\nIf you ever want to remove the utility from your Debian installed through this method, you can do so by entering the following command in your Terminal:\r\n\r\n`sudo dpkg -r python3-tlpui`\r\n\r\n![Uninstall TPL and TPL-UI](https://vitux.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/word-image-74.png)\r\n\r\nSo these were two ways through which you can use battery on your Debian system is the most efficient manner. As soon as you enable the TLP service, you will start noticing that your battery life will be prolonged, which is otherwise a frequently encountered problem with laptops running Linux.\r\n\r\ntags:\r\n\r\n#battery #debian #tlp #linux",

      "content": "Markdown Syntax\r\n\r\n# Heading\r\n\r\nStart a line with a hash character `#` to set a heading. Organize your remarks with subheadings by starting a line with additional hash characters, for example `####`. Up to six levels of headings are supported.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, on the line below the text, add any number of `==` characters for heading level 1 or `--` characters for heading level 2.\r\n\r\n**Best practices:** Markdown doesn't agree on how to handle a missing space between the number signs `#` and the heading name. For compatibility, always put a space between the number signs and the heading name.\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\n# Heading level 1\r\n## Heading level 2\r\n### Heading level 3\r\n#### Heading level 4\r\n\r\nHeading level 1\r\n===============\r\n\r\nHeading level 2\r\n---------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Heading level 1\r\n## Heading level 2\r\n### Heading level 3\r\n#### Heading level 4\r\n\r\nHeading level 1\r\n===============\r\n\r\nHeading level 2\r\n---------------\r\n\r\n# Bold\r\nTo bold text, add two asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. To bold the middle of a word for emphasis, add two asterisks without spaces around the letters.\r\n\r\n**Best practices:** Markdown doesn't handle underscores in the middle of a word. For compatibility, use asterisks to bold the middle of a word for emphasis.\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\n**This is bold text**\r\n\r\n__This is bold text__\r\n\r\nLove**is**bold\r\n```\r\n\r\n**This is bold text**\r\n__This is bold text__\r\nLove**is**bold\r\n\r\n# Italic\r\nTo italicize text, add one asterisk or underscore before and after a word or phrase. To italicize the middle of a word for emphasis, add one asterisk without spaces around the letters.\r\n\r\n**Best practices:** Markdown doesn't agree on how to handle underscores in the middle of a word. For compatibility, use asterisks to italicize the middle of a word for emphasis.\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\n*This is italic text*\r\n\r\n_This is italic text_\r\n\r\nA*cat*meow\r\n```\r\n\r\n*This is italic text*\r\n_This is italic text_\r\nA*cat*meow\r\n\r\n# Strikethrough\r\nDefines text that has been deleted from a document.

Indent one or more items to create a nested list.\r\n\r\n**Best practices:** Markdown doesn’t agree on how to handle different delimiters in the same list. For compatibility, don’t mix and match delimiters in the same list — pick one and stick with it.\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\n- First item\r\n- Second item\r\n- Third item\r\n  - First sub-item\r\n  - Second sub-item\r\n- Fourth item\r\n```\r\n\r\n- First item\r\n- Second item\r\n- Third item\r\n  - First sub-item\r\n  - Second sub-item\r\n- Fourth item\r\n\r\n# Ordered list\r\nTo create an ordered list, add line items with numbers followed by periods. The numbers don’t have to be in numerical order, but the list should start with the number one.\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\n1. First item\r\n2. Second item\r\n3. Third item\r\n   1. First sub-item\r\n   2.

Fourth item\r\n\r\n# Task list\r\nTo create a task list, add dashes `-`, asterisks `*`, or plus signs `+` and brackets with a space `[ ]` in front of task list items.  \r\nTo select a checkbox, add an x in between the brackets `[x]`.\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\n- [x] Caesar salad\r\n- [ ] Cherry tomatoes\r\n- [ ] Coconut cookies\r\n```\r\n\r\n- [x] Caesar salad\r\n- [ ] Cherry tomatoes\r\n- [ ] Coconut cookies\r\n\r\n# Quote\r\nTo create a blockquote, add a `>` in front of a paragraph.\r\n\r\nBlockquotes can contain multiple paragraphs. Add a `>` on the blank lines between the paragraphs.\r\n\r\nBlockquotes can be nested. Add a `>>` in front of the paragraph you want to nest.\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\n> First quote paragraph.\r\n>\r\n>> Nested second quote paragraph.\r\n```\r\n\r\n> First quote paragraph.\r\n>\r\n>> Nested second quote paragraph.\r\n\r\n# Code\r\nTo denote a word or phrase as code, enclose it in backticks `` ` ``.\r\n\r\nIf the word or phrase you want to denote as code includes one or more backticks, you can escape it by enclosing the word or phrase in double backticks ` `` `.\r\n\r\nTo create code blocks, indent every line of the block by at least four spaces or use three backticks ` ``` ` on the lines before and after the code block.\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\nAt the command prompt, type `nano`.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    const sum = (a, b) => a + b;\r\n    console.log(sum(3, 2));\r\n    ```\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt the command prompt, type `nano`.\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst sum = (a, b) => a + b;\r\nconsole.log(sum(3, 2));\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Link\r\nTo create a link, enclose the link text in brackets (e.g., `[NotesHub]`) and then follow it immediately with the URL in parentheses (e.g., `(https://noteshub.app)`).\r\n\r\nYou can optionally add a title for a link. This will appear as a tooltip when the user hovers over the link. To add a title, enclose it in parentheses after the URL.\r\n\r\nTo quickly turn a URL or email address into a link, enclose it in angle brackets.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can use automatic URL linking, which means any URLs will be automatically converted into links.\r\n\r\n**Best practices:** Markdown doesn’t agree on how to handle spaces in the middle of a URL.

You can optionally add pipes on either end of the table.\r\n\r\nYou can align text in the columns to the left, right, or center by adding a colon `:` to the left, right, or on both side of the hyphens within the header row.\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\n| Syntax      | Description |\r\n| ----------- | ----------- |\r\n| Header      | Title       |\r\n| Paragraph   | Text        |\r\n\r\n\r\n| Syntax      | Description | Test Text     |\r\n| :---        |    :----:   |          ---: |\r\n| Header      | Title       | Here's this   |\r\n| Paragraph   | Text        | And more      |\r\n```\r\n\r\n| Syntax      | Description |\r\n| ----------- | ----------- |\r\n| Header      | Title       |\r\n| Paragraph   | Text        |\r\n\r\n\r\n| Syntax      | Description | Test Text     |\r\n| :---        |    :----:   |          ---: |\r\n| Header      | Title       | Here's this   |\r\n| Paragraph   | Text        | And more      |\r\n\r\n# Horizontal rule\r\nTo create a horizontal rule, use three or more asterisks `***`, dashes `---`, or underscores `___` on a line by themselves.\r\n\r\n**Best practices:** For compatibility, put blank lines before and after horizontal rules.\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\n    ***\r\n    \r\n    ---\r\n    \r\n    _________________\r\n```\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n_________________\r\n\r\n# Footnotes\r\nFootnotes allow you to add notes and references without cluttering the body of the document. When you create a footnote, a superscript number with a link appears where you added the footnote reference. Readers can click the link to jump to the content of the footnote at the bottom of the page.\r\n\r\nTo create a footnote reference, add a caret and an identifier inside brackets `[^1]`. Identifiers can be numbers or words, but they can't contain spaces or tabs. Identifiers only correlate the footnote reference with the footnote itself — in the output, footnotes are numbered sequentially.\r\n\r\nAdd the footnote using another caret and number inside brackets with a colon and text (`[^1]`: My footnote.). You don't have to put footnotes at the end of the document. You can put them anywhere except inside other elements like lists, block quotes, and tables.\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\nHere's a simple footnote,[^1] and here's a longer one.[^bignote]\r\n\r\n[^1]: This is the first footnote.\r\n\r\n[^bignote]: Here's one with multiple paragraphs and code.\r\n\r\n    Indent paragraphs to include them in the footnote.\r\n\r\n    `{ my code }`\r\n\r\n    Add as many paragraphs as you like.\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere's a simple footnote,[^1] and here's a longer one.[^bignote]\r\n\r\n[^1]: This is the first footnote.\r\n\r\n[^bignote]: Here's one with multiple paragraphs and code.\r\n\r\n    Indent paragraphs to include them in the footnote.\r\n\r\n    `{ my code }`\r\n\r\n    Add as many paragraphs as you like.\r\n\r\n# Emoji\r\nThere are two ways to add emoji: copy and paste the emoji into your Markdown-formatted text, or type emoji shortcodes.\r\n\r\nIn most cases, you can simply copy an emoji from a source like [Emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/) and paste it into your document.\r\n\r\n[Emoji shortcodes](https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908) begin and end with a colon and include the name of an emoji.\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\nGone camping! :tent: Be back soon.\r\n\r\nThat is so funny! :joy:\r\n```\r\n\r\nGone camping! :tent: Be back soon.\r\n\r\nThat is so funny! :joy:\r\n\r\n# HTML\r\nIf provided formatting constructions are not enough, you can use HTML tags.\r\n\r\n```html\r\nThis is <mark>highlighted text</mark> using HTML tag\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is <mark>highlighted text</mark> using HTML tag\r\n\r\n# Merge conflict\r\nWhen during the notebook synchronization notes can't be merged without conflicts, two alternative variants will be provided so you can pick the right one.\r\n\r\n```\r\n:::conflict{variant=a}\r\nsome text\r\n:::\r\n\r\n:::conflict{variant=d}\r\naltered text\r\n:::\r\n```\r\n\r\n:::conflict{variant=a}\r\nsome text\r\n:::\r\n\r\n:::conflict{variant=d}\r\naltered text\r\n:::",

      "content": "Cortile Help  \r\n\r\nLinux auto tiling manager with hot corner support for Openbox, Fluxbox, IceWM, Xfwm, KWin, Marco, Muffin, Mutter and other [EWMH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Window_Manager_Hints#List_of_window_managers_that_support_Extended_Window_Manager_Hints) compliant window managers using the [X11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System) window system.\r\nTherefore, this project provides dynamic tiling for XFCE, LXDE, LXQt, KDE and GNOME (Mate, Deepin, Cinnamon, Budgie) based desktop environments.\r\n\r\nSimply keep your current window manager and install **cortile on top** of it.\r\nOnce enabled, the tiling manager will handle _resizing_ and _positioning_ of _existing_ and _new_ windows.\r\n<br clear=\"left\"/>\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n- [x] Workspace based tiling.\r\n- [x] Auto detection of panels.\r\n- [x] Toggle window decorations.\r\n- [x] User interface for tiling mode.\r\n- [x] Systray icon indicator and menu.\r\n- [x] Custom addons via python bindings.\r\n- [x] Keyboard, hot corner and systray bindings.\r\n- [x] Vertical, horizontal, maximized and fullscreen mode.\r\n- [x] Remember layout proportions.\r\n- [x] Floating and sticky windows.\r\n- [x] Drag & drop window swap.\r\n- [x] Workplace aware layouts.\r\n- [x] Multi monitor support.\r\n\r\nSupport for **keyboard and mouse** events sets cortile apart from other tiling solutions.\r\nThe _go_ implementation ensures a fast and responsive system, where _multiple layouts_, _keyboard shortcuts_, _drag & drop_ and _hot corner_ events simplify and speed up your daily work.\r\n\r\n[![demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leukipp/cortile/main/assets/images/demo.gif)](https://github.com/leukipp/cortile/blob/main/assets/images/demo.gif)\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nManually [download](https://github.com/leukipp/cortile/releases/latest) the latest binary file from [releases](https://github.com/leukipp/cortile/releases/latest) or use wget:\r\n```bash\r\nwget -qO- $(wget -qO- https://api.github.com/repos/leukipp/cortile/releases/latest | \\\r\njq -r '.assets[] | select(.name | contains (\"linux_amd64.tar.gz\")) | .browser_download_url') | \\\r\ntar -xvz\r\n```\r\n\r\nExecute the binary file and cortile will automatically begin tiling windows until you choose to stop it:\r\n```bash\r\n./cortile\r\n```\r\nAnother installation method can be found in the [development](#development-) section.\r\nThe latest official release is published on GitHub.\r\nVersions distributed via package managers are community supported and may be outdated.\r\n\r\n### Service\r\nTo enable auto tiling on startup, you can run cortile as a service after the graphical user interface has been loaded.\r\nA template to run cortile as a [systemd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd) service is provided in the [services](https://github.com/leukipp/cortile/tree/main/assets/services) folder.\r\nYou may have to adjust the filepath/symlink under `ExecStart` and enable the user service:\r\n```bash\r\n# copy systemd service file\r\ncp cortile.service ~/.config/systemd/user/\r\n\r\n# reload systemd configuration\r\nsystemctl --user daemon-reload\r\n\r\n# enable systemd service\r\nsystemctl --user enable cortile.service\r\n\r\n# start systemd service\r\nsystemctl --user start cortile.service\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\nThe layouts are based on the master-slave concept, where one side of the screen is considered to be the master area and the other side is considered to be the slave area:\r\n- `vertical-right:` split the screen vertically, master area on the right.\r\n- `vertical-left:` split the screen vertically, master area on the left.\r\n- `horizontal-top:` split the screen horizontally, master area on the top.\r\n- `horizontal-bottom:` split the screen horizontally, master area on the bottom.\r\n- `maximized:` single window that fills the entire tiling area.\r\n- `fullscreen:` single window that fills the entire screen.\r\n\r\nThe number of windows per side and the occupied space can be changed dynamically.\r\nAdjustments to window sizes are considered to be proportion changes of the underlying layout.\r\n\r\nWindows placed on the master side are static and the layout will only change as long the space is not fully occupied.\r\nOnce the master area is full, the slave area is used, where the layout changes dynamically based on available space and configuration settings.\r\n\r\n### Configuration  \r\n\r\nThe configuration file is located at `~/.config/cortile/config.toml` (or `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`) and is created with default values during the first startup.\r\nAdditional information about individual entries can be found in the comments section of the [config.toml](https://github.com/leukipp/cortile/blob/main/config.toml) file.\r\n\r\n[![config](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leukipp/cortile/main/assets/images/config.gif)](https://github.com/leukipp/cortile/blob/main/assets/images/config.gif)\r\n\r\n### Shortcuts\r\nThe default keyboard shortcuts are assigned as shown below. If some of them are  \r\nalready in use by your system, update the default values in the `[keys]` section of the configuration file:\r\n| Keys                                                    |

may communicate with cortile by using [dbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-Bus) directly or via the [cortile-addons](https://github.com/leukipp/cortile-addons) python bindings.\r\n\r\n### D-Bus\r\nRunning `cortile` starts a dbus server instance that makes internal properties and method calls available.\r\nSince using dbus communication directly with an external process, bash script, etc. is possible, the development requires some knowledge of dbus and is quite messy.\r\n\r\nTherefore, there is a built-in dbus client incorporated in the same cortile binary that can be started via `cortile dbus -...` as a secondary process.\r\nThis client instance communicates with the running server instance and allows to listen for events and to execute remote procedure calls.\r\n\r\nThe documentation of available properties and method calls can be found via `cortile dbus -help`.\r\n\r\n### Python\r\nAdditional python bindings are available to further simplify communication with cortile and to build a community-based library of useful snippets and examples.\r\n\r\nFor simplicity, the python bindings just spawn another cortile instance via `cortile dbus -...` running in the background and wrapping all available interfaces in easy-to-use python methods.\r\n\r\nExample scripts and detailed information's on how to get started can be found in the [cortile-addons](https://github.com/leukipp/cortile-addons) repository.\r\n\r\n### Development \r\nYou need [go >= 1.22](https://go.dev/dl/) to compile cortile.\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Install - go</summary><div>\r\n\r\n### Option 1: Install go via package manager\r\nUse a package manager supported on your system:\r\n```\r\nbash\r\n# apt\r\nsudo apt install golang\r\n\r\n# yum\r\nsudo yum install golang\r\n\r\n# dnf\r\nsudo dnf install golang\r\n\r\n# pacman\r\nsudo pacman -S go\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Option 2: Install go via archive download\r\nDownload a binary release suitable for your system:\r\n```bash\r\ncd /tmp/ && wget https://dl.google.com/go/go1.22.8.linux-amd64.tar.gz\r\nsudo tar -xvf go1.22.8.linux-amd64.tar.gz\r\nsudo mv -fi go /usr/local\r\n```\r\n\r\nSet required environment variables:\r\n```bash\r\necho \"export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin\" >> ~/.profile\r\necho \"export GOPATH=~/.go\" >> ~/.profile\r\nsource ~/.profile\r\n```\r\n\r\n</div></details>\r\n\r\nVerify the installed go version:\r\n```bash\r\ngo env | grep \"GOPATH\\|GOVERSION\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Install - cortile</summary><div>\r\n\r\n### Option 1: Install cortile via remote source\r\nInstall directly from develop branch:\r\n```bash\r\ngo install github.com/leukipp/cortile/v2@develop\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Option 2: Install cortile via local source\r\nClone source code from develop branch:\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone https://github.com/leukipp/cortile.git -b develop\r\ncd cortile\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf necessary you can make local changes, then execute:\r\n```bash\r\ngo install -ldflags=\"-X 'main.date=$(date --iso-8601=seconds)'\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n</div></details>\r\n\r\nStart cortile in verbose mode:\r\n```bash\r\n$GOPATH/bin/cortile -v\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Additional [![additional](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-pr-closed/leukipp/cortile?style=flat-square)](#additional-)\r\nSpecial use cases:\r\n- Use the `window_slaves_max` property to limit the number of windows.\r\n  - e.g. with one active master and `window_slaves_max = 2`, all windows following the third window are stacked behind the two slaves.\r\n- Use the `edge_margin` property to account for additional spaces.\r\n  - e.g. for deskbar panels or conky infographics.\r\n- Use `tiling_enabled = false` if you prefer to enable tiling only when needed.\r\n  - e.g. or to mainly utilize the hot corner functionalities.\r\n- Use [cortile-addons](https://github.com/leukipp/cortile-addons) if you need any other specific logic.\r\n  This repository offers a range of extensions and enhancements specifically designed for cortile.\r\n\r\nSecurity concerns:\r\n- Since the [dbus api](https://github.com/leukipp/cortile/tree/develop?tab=readme-ov-file#addons-) exposes internal cortile properties to the outside, malicious code running on the same host could easily access them.\r\n  However, the information cortile holds (e.g. about open windows) can also be accessed using other tools interfacing with the X11 window system.\r\n  Therefore the decision was made that direct access to cortile provides greater flexibility for running custom logic without compromising security.\r\n  - If you want to disable this feature run cortile with `cortile disable-dbus-interface`.\r\n- Any scripts placed in the `~/.config/cortile/addons/` folder will be executed when the application starts.\r\n  This provides the possibility to run custom [cortile-addons](https://github.com/leukipp/cortile/tree/develop?tab=readme-ov-file#addons-) scripts without worrying much about startup behavior and dependency issues.\r\n  However, it also creates a potential security risk, as malicious code could place files in this folder to be executed by cortile.\r\n  - If you want to disable this feature run cortile with `cortile disable-addons-folder`.\r\n- Newly pinned issues appear as menu entries in a submenu within the systray.\r\n  This feature requires a network request to the GitHub API.\r\n  - If you want to disable this feature run cortile with `cortile disable-issue-info`.\r\n- Cortile checks for new releases and provides the option for an in-place upgrade of the current binary.\r\n  Similar to the GitHub issue information, this feature also requires a network request.\r\n  - If you want to disable this feature run cortile with `cortile disable-release-info`.  \r\n- The binary file runs perfectly fine with user permissions.\r\n  - Do not run cortile as root!\r\n\r\n## Issues [![issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-closed/leukipp/cortile?style=flat-square)](#issues-)\r\nCortile works best with Xfwm and Openbox window systems.\r\nHowever, it`s still possible that you may encounter problems during usage.\r\n\r\nWindows:\r\n- It's recommended to disable all build-in window snapping features (e.g. snap to other windows, snap to screen borders).\r\n- It's recommended to disable any logic that changes the window focus other than by clicking or opening a window (e.g. focus follow mouse, scroll wheel focus). \r\n- Automatic panel detection may not work under some window managers, use the `edge_margin` property to adjust for additional margins.\r\n- Particularly in GNOME based desktop environments, window displacements or resizing issues may occur.\r\n- Sticky windows may cause unwanted layout modifications during workspace changes.\r\n- Toggling window decoration may cause unwanted layout modifications.\r\n\r\nSystray:\r\n- Adjust the bindings in the `[systray]` section, as some pointer events may not fire across different desktop environments.\r\n- Window managers not supporting [StatusNotifierItem](https://freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/StatusNotifierItem) for displaying systray icons will need to install [snixembed](https://github.com/fyne-io/systray#linuxbsd).\r\n\r\nDebugging:\r\n- If you encounter problems start the process with `cortile -vv`, which provides additional debug outputs.\r\n- A log file is created by default under `/tmp/cortile.log`.\r\n\r\n## Credits [![credits](https://img.shields.io/github/contributors/leukipp/cortile?style=flat-square)](#credits-)\r\nBased on

You can now import notes into our desktop app for Windows, Linux, and macOS\\*. To get started, select File > Import Notes from the app menu, then pick the type of notes you will be importing.\r\n\r\nYou can also import from our web app! When logged in, click the menu on the top left corner (three horizontal lines), then click on Settings and choose the Tools tab. Finally, click on Import Notes.\r\n\r\nThe options are:\r\n\r\n*   Simplenote exports (.json)\r\n*   Plain text files, including Markdown files (.txt or .md)\r\n*   Evernote export (.enex — only supported in the desktop app)\r\n\r\nYou can browse the notes you want to import or drag and drop a file into the import window. The app takes care of the rest. If you’re importing notes with Markdown formatting and you’d like to keep them that way, check the **Enable Markdown on all notes** box and they’ll be automatically configured as Markdown notes in Simplenote.\r\n\r\nNote: The import tool will import all content in the export file as new notes. It will not merge new changes to existing notes or ignore duplicate notes under your Simplenote account.\r\n\r\n\\*A quick note, Mac users! To use the importer, make sure you’re using the Electron version of the app, [available here](https://github.com/Automattic/simplenote-electron/releases/latest). The standard version of the app available in the Mac App Store doesn’t support importing yet.\r\n\r\n**Is there some way to export my notes?**\r\n\r\nYou can export your data, including notes and tags, from the [web](https://simplenote.com/help/#markdown#export_web), [Android](https://simplenote.com/help/#markdown#export_android), and [desktop apps](https://simplenote.com/help/#markdown#export_electron) for Windows, Linux and macOS\\*.\r\n\r\n**Web**\r\n\r\nYou can backup your notes by exporting them from our [web app](https://app.simplenote.com/). When logged in, click the menu on the top left corner (three horizontal lines), then click on Settings and choose the Tools tab. Finally, click on Export Notes.\r\n\r\n**Android**\r\n\r\nYou can export your notes from the Android app by opening the navigation drawer, tapping the **_Settings_** item in the drawer, and tapping the **_Export data_** option under the **_Account_** section. You will be shown the system file explorer where you can choose to save your data locally or remotely via services like Google Drive if you have a Google account on the device. You will also be able to edit the file name, which is `simplenote.json` by default.\r\n\r\n**Desktop app (Linux, Windows, macOS\\*)**\r\n\r\nYou can also export notes in the desktop app at File > Export Notes. Either method will download a .zip file of all your notes. The filename for each individual note is the first line of the note.\r\n\r\n\\*To export notes on macOS, make sure you’re using the Electron version of the app, [available here](https://github.com/Automattic/simplenote-electron/releases/latest). The standard version of the app available in the Mac App Store doesn’t support exporting yet.\r\n\r\n**How can I add a checklist?**\r\n\r\nOn our mobile apps, you’ll find a new button in the editor toolbar to add a checklist. On Desktop, head to **Format → Insert Checklist**. Nested Checklists are also supported, in case you need an extra level of organization.\r\n\r\n#### How can I share a note or collaborate with others?\r\n\r\nIf you’d like others to view and edit one of your notes or you’d like to collaborate with others, use the **Collaborate** panel in the **Action** menu (the ellipsis icon) on the note you want to share and enter their email address. The shared note will then pop up in their list of notes if they have a Simplenote account.\r\n\r\nNote that you need to select notes individually to share them as multiple notes cannot be shared at once.\r\n\r\nIf they don’t have a Simplenote account to access the note in the app, they can create one at [https://app.simplenote.com/signup/](https://app.simplenote.com/signup/).\r\n\r\nIf you’d like to share a view-only version, you can use the [publish to web feature](https://simplenote.com/help/#markdown#publish). Please note that by publishing your note, everyone with the link to the published note will be able to view the content. Avoid publishing the note if it contains sensitive data not meant for public access.\r\n\r\n#### How can I change the language?\r\n\r\nYou can change the language on Android and iOS by changing it from your device settings. At the moment Simplenote is not localized in Linux, Windows, or on the web.\r\n\r\n#### How can I change the font?\r\n\r\nWhile you can’t change the font type in the app, you can change the font size with the built-in options in the Android, Electron (Linux and Windows), and the Mac app.\r\n\r\nFor the iOS app, you can change the font size in the iOS settings: [https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202828](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202828). Please note that the changes will affect all apps on the device.\r\n\r\nFor the web app, you can adjust the font size using the browser’s shortcut, such as **Ctrl/Cmd plus +** to increase the font size or **Ctrl/Cmd plus –** to decrease the font size.\r\n\r\n##### Android\r\n\r\nTap the **Navigation** drawer, go to **Settings**, and tap **Font size**. Select the desired font size that are available: Extra small, Small, Normal, Large, and Extra large.\r\n\r\n##### Electron (Linux and Windows)\r\n\r\nGo to the **View** menu and select the **Zoom In** or **Zoom Out** option to adjust the font size. If you’d like to reset the font size to default, choose the **Actual Size** option.\r\n\r\n##### Mac\r\n\r\nGo to the **View** menu and select **Font Size** to change the font size. Select the Bigger or Smaller option based on your preference. You can also select the Reset option to change the font to the default size.\r\n\r\n#### How can I sort the notes?\r\n\r\nThe Simplenote app supports these note sorting options: **Modified: Newest, Modified: Oldest, Created: Newest, Created: Oldest, Name: A-Z,** and **Name: Z-A**. To access the sorting options for each app, please refer to the respective steps in the section below. _Please note: each note is a separate object. The title is an attribute of the object, so it is possible to create multiple notes with the same title._\r\n\r\n##### Android and iOS\r\n\r\nTo sort the notes on the Android or iOS app, tap the **Navigation** drawer, go to **Settings**, tap the **Sort order** option, and select one of the sort options.\r\n\r\n##### Electron (Linux and Windows)\r\n\r\nClick the **View** menu and select **Sort Type**. The available options are **Date modified, Date Created,** and **Alphabetical**. Click the “Reversed” option if you want the notes sorted reversely.\r\n\r\n##### Mac\r\n\r\nOn the Mac app, the note sorting option is at **Simplenote** > **Settings…** (or **Preferences…** on older macOS) > **Note sort order**.\r\n\r\n##### Web app\r\n\r\nOn the web app, you can access the note sorting option by clicking the **Navigation** drawer, going to **Settings**, selecting the **Display** tab, and scrolling down to the **SORT BY** section.\r\n\r\n#### What are the keyboard shortcuts available?\r\n\r\nThere are keyboard shortcuts for our [Android](https://simplenote.com/help/#markdown#shortcuts_android), [Electron (Linux, Windows)](https://simplenote.com/help/#markdown#shortcuts_electron), and [macOS](https://simplenote.com/help/#markdown#shortcuts_macos) apps.\r\n\r\n##### Android\r\n\r\nTap Ctrl  , to see a list of shortcuts available on the current screen. A list of all shortcuts is below.\r\n\r\n<table><tbody><tr><td>New Note</td><td><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>&nbsp;&nbsp;<kbd>Shift</kbd>&nbsp;&nbsp;<kbd>I</kbd></td></tr><tr><td>Open Search</td><td><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>&nbsp;&nbsp;<kbd>Shift</kbd>&nbsp;&nbsp;<kbd>S</kbd></td></tr><tr><td>Toggle Checklist</td><td><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>&nbsp;&nbsp;<kbd>Shift</kbd>&nbsp;&nbsp;<kbd>C</kbd></td></tr><tr><td>Toggle Preview</td><td><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>&nbsp;&nbsp;<kbd>Shift</kbd>&nbsp;&nbsp;<kbd>P</kbd></td></tr><tr><td>Toggle List</td><td><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>&nbsp;&nbsp;<kbd>Shift</kbd>&nbsp;&nbsp;<kbd>L</kbd></td></tr><tr><td>Show Information</td><td><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>&nbsp;&nbsp;<kbd>I</kbd></td></tr><tr><td>Show History</td><td><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>&nbsp;&nbsp;<kbd>H</kbd></td></tr><tr><td>Show Share</td><td><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>&nbsp;&nbsp;<kbd>S</kbd></td></tr><tr><td>Show Shortcuts</td><td><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>&nbsp;&nbsp;<kbd>,</kbd></td></tr></tbody></table>\r\n\r\n##### Electron (Linux, Windows)\r\n\r\nType Ctrl / to view all shortcuts. Here are some common ones:\r\n\r\n<table><tbody><tr><td>New Note</td><td><kbd>Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>Shift</kbd> <kbd>I</kbd></td></tr><tr><td>Search Notes</td><td><kbd>Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>Shift</kbd> <kbd>S</kbd></td></tr><tr><td>Insert a checklist item</td><td><kbd>Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>Shift</kbd> <kbd>C</kbd></td></tr><tr><td>Toggle focus mode</td><td><kbd>Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>Shift</kbd> <kbd>F</kbd></td></tr><tr><td>Toggle Markdown preview</td><td><kbd>Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>Shift</kbd> <kbd>P</kbd></td></tr><tr><td>Increase font size</td><td><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>&nbsp;&nbsp;<kbd>+</kbd></td></tr><tr><td>Decrease font size</td><td><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>&nbsp;&nbsp;<kbd>-</kbd></td></tr><tr><td>Reset font size</td><td><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>&nbsp;&nbsp;<kbd>0</kbd></td></tr><tr><td>Show keyboard shortcuts</td><td><kbd>Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>/</kbd></td></tr></tbody></table>\r\n\r\n##### macOS\r\n\r\n<table><tbody><tr><td>New Note</td><td><kbd>Command</kbd>&nbsp;&nbsp;<kbd>N</kbd></td></tr><tr><td>Print Note</td><td><kbd>Command</kbd>&nbsp;&nbsp;<kbd>P</kbd></td></tr><tr><td>Move focus to search field</td><td><kbd>Command</kbd>&nbsp;&nbsp;<kbd>L</kbd></td></tr><tr><td>Increase font size</td><td><kbd>Command</kbd>&nbsp;&nbsp;<kbd>+</kbd></td></tr><tr><td>Decrease font size</td><td><kbd>Command</kbd>&nbsp;&nbsp;<kbd>-</kbd></td></tr><tr><td>Reset font size</td><td><kbd>Command</kbd>&nbsp;&nbsp;<kbd>0</kbd></td></tr><tr><td>Delete note</td><td><kbd>Shift</kbd> <kbd>Command</kbd> <kbd>Backspace</kbd></td></tr></tbody></table>\r\n\r\n#### Can I use Simplenote offline?\r\n\r\nAll Simplenote apps are designed to be used offline. You can access your notes in the apps without an internet connection, provided you have signed in and downloaded all your notes when you’re online.\r\n\r\nHowever, the web app is slightly different in that it requires an internet connection to access the browser tab at [https://app.simplenote.com](https://app.simplenote.com). If you’re already offline when you want to open the web app, it won’t be accessible. With that said, we have a workaround solution for you, so read on.\r\n\r\nTo access your notes in the web app offline, use a browser that supports Progressive Web Apps (such as Chrome, Edge, or Firefox with an appropriate extension). By installing the app as a Progressive Web App when you are online and logged in to your Simplenote account, you’ll have offline access to Simplenote on your desktop.\r\n\r\n[![](https://simplenote.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image.png?w=872)](https://simplenote.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image.png)\r\n\r\nFor mobile and Mac users, we recommend using native apps, which you can download from the Google Play Store and App Store.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\n#### Can I print my notes?\r\n\r\nYes! You can print your notes using our [web](https://simplenote.com/help/#markdown#print_web), [Android](https://simplenote.com/help/#markdown#print_android), [Electron (Linux, Windows)](https://simplenote.com/help/#markdown#print_electron), [iOS](https://simplenote.com/help/#markdown#print_ios), and [macOS](https://simplenote.com/help/#markdown#print_macos) apps.\r\n\r\n##### Web\r\n\r\nOpen your browser printing options and choose the option to print the selection. Different browsers will offer different options for this.\r\n\r\n##### Android\r\n\r\nOpen your note, and publish it to web. Open the link in your browser (might differ depending on your browser app), and **Share** the link. You will see “Print” as an option.\r\n\r\n##### Electron (Linux, Windows)\r\n\r\nOpen your note and use the **File** -> **Print** menu option or Ctrl P.\r\n\r\n##### iOS\r\n\r\nOpen your note, click on the **Info** in the panel, and select “Send.” You will see “Print” as an option.\r\n\r\n##### macOS\r\n\r\nOpen Simplenote, and click on the “Note” settings. You will see the option to Print your note using your system’s preferences.\r\n\r\n#### How does syncing work?\r\n\r\nAll notes are synced between your device, the web app, and any desktop apps that you might have downloaded. When you create, edit, or delete notes in any of these locations, they automatically and wirelessly sync to the other locations as well as soon as you open the app.\r\n\r\n#### Can I add an image?\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to upload or attach anything to a note in Simplenote other than text. That said, you can use Markdown to embed an image by using the URL of an image hosted on the web.\r\n\r\nTo embed an image, put an exclamation mark (`!`) before the enclosed image text in brackets (e.g., `![Image]`) and then follow it immediately with the URL in parentheses (e.g., `(https://cldup.com/DqxSeQlvga.png)`).\r\n\r\n```\r\n![Image](https://cldup.com/DqxSeQlvga.png)\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Can I use Markdown?\r\n\r\nYes! Markdown is supported on our [web](https://simplenote.com/help/#markdown#markdown_web), [Android](https://simplenote.com/help/#markdown#markdown_android), [Electron (Linux, Windows)](https://simplenote.com/help/#markdown#markdown_electron), and [iOS](https://simplenote.com/help/#markdown#markdown_ios) apps.\r\n\r\n##### Web\r\n\r\nOpen a note for editing then select the Actions icon (the icon with three dots in a circle at the very top of the screen) and then check the option next to “Markdown”.\r\n\r\n##### Android\r\n\r\nYou can enable and disable Markdown on a per-note basis by tapping the ellipsis action in the top app bar while viewing a note and tapping the Markdown checkbox. Simplenote Android will remember the last time you enabled or disabled Markdown on a note and apply that setting when notes are created.\r\n\r\nMarkdown on Android does not support HTML tags. Entering something like `<b>`, `<i>`, `<br>`, or `<img>` will show the tag exactly as it is written and not formatted. The supported syntax is shown below.\r\n\r\nTo use single spacing, add two spaces ( ) followed by one new line to the end of a line. To use double spacing, add two new lines to the end of a line.\r\n\r\nTo create a heading, add number signs (`#`) in front of a word or phrase. The number of number signs you use should correspond to the heading level.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Heading 1\r\n## Heading 2\r\n### Heading \r\n#### Heading 4\r\n##### Heading 5\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Heading 1\r\n\r\n## Heading 2\r\n\r\n### Heading 3\r\n\r\n#### Heading 4\r\n\r\n##### Heading 5\r\n\r\nTo bold text, add two asterisks (`**`) or underscores (`__`) before and after a word or phrase. To italicize text, add one asterisk (`*`) or underscore (`_`) before and after a word or phrase. To emphasize text with bold and italics at the same time, add any combination of three asterisks (`***`) or underscores (`___`) before and after a word or phrase.\r\n\r\n```\r\n**Bold**\r\n*Italic*\r\n_Italic_\r\n***Bold/Italic***\r\n_**Bold/Italic**_\r\n__*Bold/Italic*__\r\n___Bold/Italic___\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Bold**  \r\n_Italic_  \r\n_Italic_  \r\n_**Bold/Italic**_  \r\n**_Bold/Italic_**  \r\n**_Bold/Italic_**  \r\n**_Bold/Italic_**\r\n\r\nTo create a blockquote, add a chevron pointing right (`>`) in front of a paragraph.\r\n\r\n```\r\n&gt; Blockquote\r\n```\r\n\r\n> Blockquote\r\n\r\nTo denote a word or phrase as code inline with other text, enclose it in backticks (`` ` ``).\r\n\r\n```\r\n`Code Inline`\r\n```\r\n\r\n`Code Inline`\r\n\r\nTo create code blocks, add three backticks (` ``` `) before and after the block of text. Alternatively, indent every line of the block by at least four spaces ( ) or one tab.\r\n\r\n````\r\n```\r\nCode Block\r\n```\r\n````\r\n\r\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"><tbody><tr><td class=\"code\"><div class=\"container\"><div class=\"line number1 index0 alt2\"><code class=\"plain plain\">Code Block</code></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table>\r\n\r\n```\r\n    Code Block\r\n```\r\n\r\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"><tbody><tr><td class=\"code\"><div class=\"container\"><div class=\"line number1 index0 alt2\"><code class=\"plain plain\">Code Block</code></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table>\r\n\r\nTo create an unordered list, add dashes (`-`), plus signs (`+`), asterisks (`*`), or bullet points (`•`) in front of line items.\r\n\r\n```\r\n- Dash 1\r\n- Dash 2\r\n- Dash 3\r\n```\r\n\r\n*   Dash 1\r\n*   Dash 2\r\n*   Dash 3\r\n\r\n```\r\n+ Plus 1\r\n+ Plus 2\r\n+ Plus 3\r\n```\r\n\r\n*   Plus 1\r\n*   Plus 2\r\n*   Plus 3\r\n\r\n```\r\n* Asterisk 1\r\n* Asterisk 2\r\n* Asterisk 3\r\n```\r\n\r\n*   Asterisk 1\r\n*   Asterisk 2\r\n*   Asterisk 3\r\n\r\n```\r\n• Bullet 1\r\n• Bullet 2\r\n• Bullet 3\r\n```\r\n\r\n*   Bullet 1\r\n*   Bullet 2\r\n*   Bullet 3\r\n\r\nTo create a checklist, add a dash (`-`), space ( ), and square brackets (`[]`) surrounding a space ( ) or x (`x`) in front of the items.\r\n\r\n```\r\n- [x] Checked 1\r\n- [x] Checked 2\r\n- [x] Checked 3\r\n- [ ] Unchecked 1\r\n- [ ] Unchecked 2\r\n- [ ] Unchecked 3\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo create an ordered list, add line items with numbers followed by periods.\r\n\r\n```\r\n1.

Here’s a small sampling of what you can do with Markdown:\r\n\r\n\\# heading 1  \r\n\\## heading 2  \r\n\\### heading 3  \r\n\\_Italics\\_  \r\n\\*\\*Bold\\*\\*  \r\n\\*\\*\\_Italics and Bold\\_\\*\\*  \r\nLinks: \\[Simplenote\\]([https://simplenote.com/](https://simplenote.com/))\r\n\r\nLists:\r\n\r\n– Thing 1  \r\n– Thing 2  \r\n– Thing 3\r\n\r\nEmbed an image:  \r\n!\\[alt\\]([https://path\\_to\\_image.png](https://path_to_image.png/))\r\n\r\n##### iOS\r\n\r\nClick on the **Info** panel icon and toggle the markdown setting. Once enabled, you can swipe left to preview your markdown notes, and swipe right to continue editing.\r\n\r\nNote: Markdown helps format your text, but can’t insert specific letters like Delta. Any device you use will have a different method for inserting characters like delta. Please follow up with your device’s support should you want to use special characters.\r\n\r\n#### How does publishing work?\r\n\r\nPublishing notes is a way to share notes on the web for others to read. Just tap the **Action** panel icon (the ellipsis icon) when viewing a note, then tap **Publish**. Within seconds you’ll be able to share a link to get the word out.\r\n\r\nPlease note that by publishing your note, everyone with the link to the published note will be able to view the content. Avoid publishing the note if it contains sensitive data not meant for public access.\r\n\r\n#### What’s the maximum length of a note?\r\n\r\nYou can create very long notes if you absolutely have to, but we don’t recommend making notes longer than several thousand words. Huge notes can take a long time to process both in the web app and on your device.\r\n\r\nYou can break long notes up into multiple notes and link between them using [internal links](https://simplenote.com/help/#markdown#internal-links).\r\n\r\n#### How many notes can I make?\r\n\r\nWe don’t currently place any restrictions on the number of notes you can make, as long as you’re not abusing the system.\r\n\r\n#### How do internal links work?\r\n\r\nInternal links allow you to link to one note from within another note. You can read more about how to use them on this blog post: [https://simplenote.com/2020/11/03/introducing-internal-links/](https://simplenote.com/2020/11/03/introducing-internal-links/)\r\n\r\n#### How can I organize my notes?\r\n\r\nYou can organize your notes by adding tags to a note at the bottom of the note editing screen. There isn’t a hard limit on the number of tags you can add to a note, but we do not recommend adding more than 10 as it’ll be challenging to keep track and manage.\r\n\r\nTo search notes by a tag, enter `tag:` followed by the tag name in the search bar. For example, if you want to see the list of notes tagged with `groceries`, enter `tag:groceries` in the search bar.\r\n\r\nWhile you can filter notes by tags temporarily this way, you can’t hide notes with certain tags added from the All Notes list.\r\n",

A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While Markdown’s syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters – including [Setext](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/mirror/setext.html), [atx](http://www.aaronsw.com/2002/atx/), [Textile](https://web.archive.org/web/20021226035527/http://textism.com/tools/textile/), [reStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html), [Grutatext](http://www.triptico.com/software/grutatxt.html), and [EtText](http://ettext.taint.org/doc/) – the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown’s syntax is the format of plain text email.\r\n\r\nTo this end, Markdown’s syntax is comprised entirely of punctuation characters, which punctuation characters have been carefully chosen so as to look like what they mean. E.g., asterisks around a word actually look like \\*emphasis\\*. Markdown lists look like, well, lists. Even blockquotes look like quoted passages of text, assuming you’ve ever used email.\r\n\r\n### Inline HTML\r\n\r\nMarkdown’s syntax is intended for one purpose: to be used as a format for *writing* for the web.\r\n\r\nMarkdown is not a replacement for HTML, or even close to it. Its syntax is very small, corresponding only to a very small subset of HTML tags. The idea is *not* to create a syntax that makes it easier to insert HTML tags. In my opinion, HTML tags are already easy to insert. The idea for Markdown is to make it easy to read, write, and edit prose. HTML is a *publishing* format; Markdown is a *writing* format. Thus, Markdown’s formatting syntax only addresses issues that can be conveyed in plain text.\r\n\r\nFor any markup that is not covered by Markdown’s syntax, you simply use HTML itself. There’s no need to preface it or delimit it to indicate that you’re switching from Markdown to HTML; you just use the tags.\r\n\r\nThe only restrictions are that block-level HTML elements – e.g. `<div>`, `<table>`, `<pre>`, `<p>`, etc. – must be separated from surrounding content by blank lines, and the start and end tags of the block should not be indented with tabs or spaces. Markdown is smart enough not to add extra (unwanted) `<p>` tags around HTML block-level tags.\r\n\r\nFor example, to add an HTML table to a Markdown article:\r\n\r\n```\r\nThis is a regular paragraph.\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <td>Foo</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\nThis is another regular paragraph.\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that Markdown formatting syntax is not processed within block-level HTML tags. E.g., you can’t use Markdown-style `*emphasis*` inside an HTML block.\r\n\r\nSpan-level HTML tags – e.g. `<span>`, `<cite>`, or `<del>` – can be used anywhere in a Markdown paragraph, list item, or header. If you want, you can even use HTML tags instead of Markdown formatting; e.g. if you’d prefer to use HTML `<a>` or `<img>` tags instead of Markdown’s link or image syntax, go right ahead.\r\n\r\nUnlike block-level HTML tags, Markdown syntax *is* processed within span-level tags.\r\n\r\n### Automatic Escaping for Special Characters\r\n\r\nIn HTML, there are two characters that demand special treatment: `<` and `&`. Left angle brackets are used to start tags; ampersands are used to denote HTML entities. If you want to use them as literal characters, you must escape them as entities, e.g. `&lt;`, and `&amp;`.\r\n\r\nAmpersands in particular are bedevilling for web writers. If you want to write about ‘AT&T’, you need to write ‘`AT&amp;T`’. You even need to escape ampersands within URLs. Thus, if you want to link to:\r\n\r\n```\r\nhttp://images.google.com/images?num=30&q=larry+bird\r\n```\r\n\r\nyou need to encode the URL as:\r\n\r\n```\r\nhttp://images.google.com/images?num=30&amp;q=larry+bird\r\n```\r\n\r\nin your anchor tag `href` attribute. Needless to say, this is easy to forget, and is probably the single most common source of HTML validation errors in otherwise well-marked-up web sites.\r\n\r\nMarkdown allows you to use these characters naturally, taking care of all the necessary escaping for you. If you use an ampersand as part of an HTML entity, it remains unchanged; otherwise it will be translated into `&amp;`.\r\n\r\nSo, if you want to include a copyright symbol in your article, you can write:\r\n\r\n```\r\n&copy;\r\n```\r\n\r\nand Markdown will leave it alone. But if you write:\r\n\r\n```\r\nAT&T\r\n```\r\n\r\nMarkdown will translate it to:\r\n\r\n```\r\nAT&amp;T\r\n```\r\n\r\nSimilarly, because Markdown supports [inline HTML](#html), if you use angle brackets as delimiters for HTML tags, Markdown will treat them as such. But if you write:\r\n\r\n```\r\n4 < 5\r\n```\r\n\r\nMarkdown will translate it to:\r\n\r\n```\r\n4 &lt; 5\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, inside Markdown code spans and blocks, angle brackets and ampersands are *always* encoded automatically. This makes it easy to use Markdown to write about HTML code. (As opposed to raw HTML, which is a terrible format for writing about HTML syntax, because every single `<` and `&` in your example code needs to be escaped.)\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\n## Block Elements\r\n\r\n### Paragraphs and Line Breaks\r\n\r\nA paragraph is simply one or more consecutive lines of text, separated by one or more blank lines. (A blank line is any line that looks like a blank line – a line containing nothing but spaces or tabs is considered blank.) Normal paragraphs should not be indented with spaces or tabs.\r\n\r\nThe implication of the “one or more consecutive lines of text” rule is that Markdown supports “hard-wrapped” text paragraphs. This differs significantly from most other text-to-HTML formatters (including Movable Type’s “Convert Line Breaks” option) which translate every line break character in a paragraph into a `<br />` tag.\r\n\r\nWhen you *do* want to insert a `<br />` break tag using Markdown, you end a line with two or more spaces, then type return.\r\n\r\nYes, this takes a tad more effort to create a `<br />`, but a simplistic “every line break is a `<br />`” rule wouldn’t work for Markdown. Markdown’s email-style [blockquoting](#blockquote) and multi-paragraph [list items](#list) work best – and look better – when you format them with hard breaks.\r\n\r\n### Headers\r\n\r\nMarkdown supports two styles of headers, \\[Setext\\] [1](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/mirror/setext.html) and \\[atx\\] [2](http://www.aaronsw.com/2002/atx/).\r\n\r\nSetext-style headers are “underlined” using equal signs (for first-level headers) and dashes (for second-level headers). For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nThis is an H1\r\n=============\r\n\r\nThis is an H2\r\n-------------\r\n```\r\n\r\nAny number of underlining `=`'s or `-`'s will work.\r\n\r\nAtx-style headers use 1-6 hash characters at the start of the line, corresponding to header levels 1-6. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# This is an H1\r\n\r\n## This is an H2\r\n\r\n###### This is an H6\r\n```\r\n\r\nOptionally, you may “close” atx-style headers. This is purely cosmetic – you can use this if you think it looks better. The closing hashes don’t even need to match the number of hashes used to open the header. (The number of opening hashes determines the header level.) :\r\n\r\n```\r\n# This is an H1 #\r\n\r\n## This is an H2 ##\r\n\r\n### This is an H3 ######\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Blockquotes\r\n\r\nMarkdown uses email-style `>` characters for blockquoting. If you’re familiar with quoting passages of text in an email message, then you know how to create a blockquote in Markdown. It looks best if you hard wrap the text and put a `>` before every line:\r\n\r\n```\r\n> This is a blockquote with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,\r\n> consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus.\r\n> Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus.\r\n> \r\n> Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit. Suspendisse\r\n> id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.\r\n```\r\n\r\nMarkdown allows you to be lazy and only put the `>` before the first line of a hard-wrapped paragraph:\r\n\r\n```\r\n> This is a blockquote with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,\r\nconsectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus.\r\nVestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus.\r\n\r\n> Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit. Suspendisse\r\nid sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.\r\n```\r\n\r\nBlockquotes can be nested (i.e. a blockquote-in-a-blockquote) by adding additional levels of `>`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n> This is the first level of quoting.\r\n>\r\n> > This is nested blockquote.\r\n>\r\n> Back to the first level.\r\n```\r\n\r\nBlockquotes can contain other Markdown elements, including headers, lists, and code blocks:\r\n\r\n```\r\n> ## This is a header.\r\n> \r\n> 1.   This is the first list item.\r\n> 2.   This is the second list item.\r\n> \r\n> Here's some example code:\r\n> \r\n>     return shell_exec(\"echo $input | $markdown_script\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nAny decent text editor should make email-style quoting easy. For example, with BBEdit, you can make a selection and choose Increase Quote Level from the Text menu.\r\n\r\n### Lists\r\n\r\nMarkdown supports ordered (numbered) and unordered (bulleted) lists.\r\n\r\nUnordered lists use asterisks, pluses, and hyphens – interchangeability – as list markers:\r\n\r\n```\r\n*   Red\r\n*   Green\r\n*   Blue\r\n```\r\n\r\nis equivalent to:\r\n\r\n```\r\n+   Red\r\n+   Green\r\n+   Blue\r\n```\r\n\r\nand:\r\n\r\n```\r\n-   Red\r\n-   Green\r\n-   Blue\r\n```\r\n\r\nOrdered lists use numbers followed by periods:\r\n\r\n```\r\n1.  Bird\r\n2.  McHale\r\n3.  Parish\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt’s important to note that the actual numbers you use to mark the list have no effect on the HTML output Markdown produces. The HTML Markdown produces from the above list is:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Bird</li>\r\n<li>McHale</li>\r\n<li>Parish</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you instead wrote the list in Markdown like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n1.  Bird\r\n1.  McHale\r\n1.  Parish\r\n```\r\n\r\nor even:\r\n\r\n```\r\n3. Bird\r\n1. McHale\r\n8. Parish\r\n```\r\n\r\nyou’d get the exact same HTML output. The point is, if you want to, you can use ordinal numbers in your ordered Markdown lists, so that the numbers in your source match the numbers in your published HTML. But if you want to be lazy, you don’t have to.\r\n\r\nIf you do use lazy list numbering, however, you should still start the list with the number 1. At some point in the future, Markdown may support starting ordered lists at an arbitrary number.\r\n\r\nList markers typically start at the left margin, but may be indented by up to three spaces. List markers must be followed by one or more spaces or a tab.\r\n\r\nTo make lists look nice, you can wrap items with hanging indents:\r\n\r\n```\r\n*   Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.\r\n    Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus. Vestibulum enim wisi,\r\n    viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus.\r\n*   Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit.\r\n    Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut if you want to be lazy, you don’t have to:\r\n\r\n```\r\n*   Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.\r\nAliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus. Vestibulum enim wisi,\r\nviverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus.\r\n*   Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit.\r\nSuspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf list items are separated by blank lines, Markdown will wrap the items in `<p>` tags in the HTML output. For example, this input:\r\n\r\n```\r\n*   Bird\r\n*   Magic\r\n```\r\n\r\nwill turn into:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Bird</li>\r\n<li>Magic</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n*   Bird\r\n\r\n*   Magic\r\n```\r\n\r\nwill turn into:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p>Bird</p></li>\r\n<li><p>Magic</p></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n```\r\n\r\nList items may consist of multiple paragraphs. Each subsequent paragraph in a list item must be indented by either 4 spaces or one tab:\r\n\r\n```\r\n1.  This is a list item with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum dolor\r\n    sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam hendrerit\r\n    mi posuere lectus.\r\n\r\n    Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet\r\n    vitae, risus. Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum\r\n    sit amet velit.\r\n\r\n2.  Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt looks nice if you indent every line of the subsequent paragraphs, but here again, Markdown will allow you to be lazy:\r\n\r\n```\r\n*   This is a list item with two paragraphs.\r\n\r\n    This is the second paragraph in the list item. You're\r\nonly required to indent the first line. Lorem ipsum dolor\r\nsit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.\r\n\r\n*   Another item in the same list.\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo put a blockquote within a list item, the blockquote’s `>` delimiters need to be indented:\r\n\r\n```\r\n*   A list item with a blockquote:\r\n\r\n    > This is a blockquote\r\n    > inside a list item.\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo put a code block within a list item, the code block needs to be indented *twice* – 8 spaces or two tabs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n*   A list item with a code block:\r\n\r\n        <code goes here>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt’s worth noting that it’s possible to trigger an ordered list by accident, by writing something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n1986. What a great season.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn other words, a *number-period-space* sequence at the beginning of a line. To avoid this, you can backslash-escape the period:\r\n\r\n```\r\n1986\\. What a great season.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Code Blocks\r\n\r\nPre-formatted code blocks are used for writing about programming or markup source code. Rather than forming normal paragraphs, the lines of a code block are interpreted literally. Markdown wraps a code block in both `<pre>` and `<code>` tags.\r\n\r\nTo produce a code block in Markdown, simply indent every line of the block by at least 4 spaces or 1 tab. For example, given this input:\r\n\r\n```\r\nThis is a normal paragraph:\r\n\r\n    This is a code block.\r\n```\r\n\r\nMarkdown will generate:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<p>This is a normal paragraph:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>This is a code block.\r\n</code></pre>\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne level of indentation – 4 spaces or 1 tab – is removed from each line of the code block. For example, this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nHere is an example of AppleScript:\r\n\r\n    tell application \"Foo\"\r\n        beep\r\n    end tell\r\n```\r\n\r\nwill turn into:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<p>Here is an example of AppleScript:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>tell application \"Foo\"\r\n    beep\r\nend tell\r\n</code></pre>\r\n```\r\n\r\nA code block continues until it reaches a line that is not indented (or the end of the article).\r\n\r\nWithin a code block, ampersands (`&`) and angle brackets (`<` and `>`) are automatically converted into HTML entities. This makes it very easy to include example HTML source code using Markdown – just paste it and indent it, and Markdown will handle the hassle of encoding the ampersands and angle brackets. For example, this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    <div class=\"footer\">\r\n        &copy; 2004 Foo Corporation\r\n    </div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nwill turn into:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<pre><code>&lt;div class=\"footer\"&gt;\r\n    &amp;copy; 2004 Foo Corporation\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n</code></pre>\r\n```\r\n\r\nRegular Markdown syntax is not processed within code blocks. E.g., asterisks are just literal asterisks within a code block. This means it’s also easy to use Markdown to write about Markdown’s own syntax.\r\n\r\n### Horizontal Rules\r\n\r\nYou can produce a horizontal rule tag (`<hr />`) by placing three or more hyphens, asterisks, or underscores on a line by themselves. If you wish, you may use spaces between the hyphens or asterisks. Each of the following lines will produce a horizontal rule:\r\n\r\n```\r\n* * *\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n- - -\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\n## Span Elements\r\n\r\n### Links\r\n\r\nMarkdown supports two style of links: *inline* and *reference*.\r\n\r\nIn both styles, the link text is delimited by \\[square brackets\\].\r\n\r\nTo create an inline link, use a set of regular parentheses immediately after the link text’s closing square bracket. Inside the parentheses, put the URL where you want the link to point, along with an *optional* title for the link, surrounded in quotes. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nThis is [an example](http://example.com/ \"Title\") inline link.\r\n\r\n[This link](http://example.net/) has no title attribute.\r\n```\r\n\r\nWill produce:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<p>This is <a href=\"http://example.com/\" title=\"Title\">\r\nan example</a> inline link.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://example.net/\">This link</a> has no\r\ntitle attribute.</p>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you’re referring to a local resource on the same server, you can use relative paths:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSee my [About](/about/) page for details.   \r\n```\r\n\r\nReference-style links use a second set of square brackets, inside which you place a label of your choosing to identify the link:\r\n\r\n```\r\nThis is [an example][id] reference-style link.\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can optionally use a space to separate the sets of brackets:\r\n\r\n```\r\nThis is [an example] [id] reference-style link.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, anywhere in the document, you define your link label like this, on a line by itself:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[id]: http://example.com/  \"Optional Title Here\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat is:\r\n\r\n- Square brackets containing the link identifier (optionally indented from the left margin using up to three spaces);\r\n- followed by a colon;\r\n- followed by one or more spaces (or tabs);\r\n- followed by the URL for the link;\r\n- optionally followed by a title attribute for the link, enclosed in double or single quotes, or enclosed in parentheses.\r\n\r\nThe following three link definitions are equivalent:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[foo]: http://example.com/  \"Optional Title Here\"\r\n[foo]: http://example.com/  'Optional Title Here'\r\n[foo]: http://example.com/  (Optional Title Here)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Note:** There is a known bug in Markdown.pl 1.0.1 which prevents single quotes from being used to delimit link titles.\r\n\r\nThe link URL may, optionally, be surrounded by angle brackets:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[id]: <http://example.com/>  \"Optional Title Here\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can put the title attribute on the next line and use extra spaces or tabs for padding, which tends to look better with longer URLs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[id]: http://example.com/longish/path/to/resource/here\r\n    \"Optional Title Here\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nLink definitions are only used for creating links during Markdown processing, and are stripped from your document in the HTML output.\r\n\r\nLink definition names may consist of letters, numbers, spaces, and punctuation – but they are *not* case sensitive. E.g. these two links:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[link text][a]\r\n[link text][A]\r\n```\r\n\r\nare equivalent.\r\n\r\nThe *implicit link name* shortcut allows you to omit the name of the link, in which case the link text itself is used as the name. Just use an empty set of square brackets – e.g., to link the word “Google” to the google.com web site, you could simply write:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[Google][]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then define the link:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[Google]: http://google.com/\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause link names may contain spaces, this shortcut even works for multiple words in the link text:\r\n\r\n```\r\nVisit [Daring Fireball][] for more information.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then define the link:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[Daring Fireball]: http://daringfireball.net/\r\n```\r\n\r\nLink definitions can be placed anywhere in your Markdown document. I tend to put them immediately after each paragraph in which they’re used, but if you want, you can put them all at the end of your document, sort of like footnotes.\r\n\r\nHere’s an example of reference links in action:\r\n\r\n```\r\nI get 10 times more traffic from [Google] [1] than from\r\n[Yahoo] [2] or [MSN] [3].\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://google.com/        \"Google\"\r\n  [2]: http://search.yahoo.com/  \"Yahoo Search\"\r\n  [3]: http://search.msn.com/    \"MSN Search\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing the implicit link name shortcut, you could instead write:\r\n\r\n```\r\nI get 10 times more traffic from [Google][] than from\r\n[Yahoo][] or [MSN][].\r\n\r\n  [google]: http://google.com/        \"Google\"\r\n  [yahoo]:  http://search.yahoo.com/  \"Yahoo Search\"\r\n  [msn]:    http://search.msn.com/    \"MSN Search\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nBoth of the above examples will produce the following HTML output:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<p>I get 10 times more traffic from <a href=\"http://google.com/\"\r\ntitle=\"Google\">Google</a> than from\r\n<a href=\"http://search.yahoo.com/\" title=\"Yahoo Search\">Yahoo</a>\r\nor <a href=\"http://search.msn.com/\" title=\"MSN Search\">MSN</a>.</p>\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor comparison, here is the same paragraph written using Markdown’s inline link style:\r\n\r\n```\r\nI get 10 times more traffic from [Google](http://google.com/ \"Google\")\r\nthan from [Yahoo](http://search.yahoo.com/ \"Yahoo Search\") or\r\n[MSN](http://search.msn.com/ \"MSN Search\").\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe point of reference-style links is not that they’re easier to write. The point is that with reference-style links, your document source is vastly more readable. Compare the above examples: using reference-style links, the paragraph itself is only 81 characters long; with inline-style links, it’s 176 characters; and as raw HTML, it’s 234 characters. In the raw HTML, there’s more markup than there is text.\r\n\r\nWith Markdown’s reference-style links, a source document much more closely resembles the final output, as rendered in a browser. By allowing you to move the markup-related metadata out of the paragraph, you can add links without interrupting the narrative flow of your prose.\r\n\r\n### Emphasis\r\n\r\nMarkdown treats asterisks (`*`) and underscores (`_`) as indicators of emphasis. Text wrapped with one `*` or `_` will be wrapped with an HTML `<em>` tag; double `*`'s or `_`'s will be wrapped with an HTML `<strong>` tag. E.g., this input:\r\n\r\n```\r\n*single asterisks*\r\n\r\n_single underscores_\r\n\r\n**double asterisks**\r\n\r\n__double underscores__\r\n```\r\n\r\nwill produce:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<em>single asterisks</em>\r\n\r\n<em>single underscores</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>double asterisks</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>double underscores</strong>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can use whichever style you prefer; the lone restriction is that the same character must be used to open and close an emphasis span.\r\n\r\nEmphasis can be used in the middle of a word:\r\n\r\n```\r\nun*frigging*believable\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut if you surround an `*` or `_` with spaces, it’ll be treated as a literal asterisk or underscore.\r\n\r\nTo produce a literal asterisk or underscore at a position where it would otherwise be used as an emphasis delimiter, you can backslash escape it:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\\*this text is surrounded by literal asterisks\\*\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Code\r\n\r\nTo indicate a span of code, wrap it with backtick quotes (`` ` ``). Unlike a pre-formatted code block, a code span indicates code within a normal paragraph. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nUse the `printf()` function.\r\n```\r\n\r\nwill produce:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<p>Use the <code>printf()</code> function.</p>\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo include a literal backtick character within a code span, you can use multiple backticks as the opening and closing delimiters:\r\n\r\n```\r\n``There is a literal backtick (`) here.``\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich will produce this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<p><code>There is a literal backtick (`) here.</code></p>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe backtick delimiters surrounding a code span may include spaces – one after the opening, one before the closing. This allows you to place literal backtick characters at the beginning or end of a code span:\r\n\r\n```\r\nA single backtick in a code span: `` ` ``\r\n\r\nA backtick-delimited string in a code span: `` `foo` ``\r\n```\r\n\r\nwill produce:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<p>A single backtick in a code span: <code>`</code></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A backtick-delimited string in a code span: <code>`foo`</code></p>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith a code span, ampersands and angle brackets are encoded as HTML entities automatically, which makes it easy to include example HTML tags. Markdown will turn this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPlease don't use any `<blink>` tags.\r\n```\r\n\r\ninto:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<p>Please don't use any <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> tags.</p>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can write this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n`&#8212;` is the decimal-encoded equivalent of `&mdash;`.\r\n```\r\n\r\nto produce:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<p><code>&amp;#8212;</code> is the decimal-encoded\r\nequivalent of <code>&amp;mdash;</code>.</p>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Images\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, it’s fairly difficult to devise a “natural” syntax for placing images into a plain text document format.\r\n\r\nMarkdown uses an image syntax that is intended to resemble the syntax for links, allowing for two styles: *inline* and *reference*.\r\n\r\nInline image syntax looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n![Alt text](/path/to/img.jpg)\r\n\r\n![Alt text](/path/to/img.jpg \"Optional title\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat is:\r\n\r\n- An exclamation mark: `!`;\r\n- followed by a set of square brackets, containing the `alt` attribute text for the image;\r\n- followed by a set of parentheses, containing the URL or path to the image, and an optional `title` attribute enclosed in double or single quotes.\r\n\r\nReference-style image syntax looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n![Alt text][id]\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere “id” is the name of a defined image reference. Image references are defined using syntax identical to link references:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[id]: url/to/image  \"Optional title attribute\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs of this writing, Markdown has no syntax for specifying the dimensions of an image; if this is important to you, you can simply use regular HTML `<img>` tags.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\n## Miscellaneous\r\n\r\n### Automatic Links\r\n\r\nMarkdown supports a shortcut style for creating “automatic” links for URLs and email addresses: simply surround the URL or email address with angle brackets. What this means is that if you want to show the actual text of a URL or email address, and also have it be a clickable link, you can do this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<http://example.com/>\r\n```\r\n\r\nMarkdown will turn this into:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<a href=\"http://example.com/\">http://example.com/</a>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAutomatic links for email addresses work similarly, except that Markdown will also perform a bit of randomized decimal and hex entity-encoding to help obscure your address from address-harvesting spambots. For example, Markdown will turn this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<address@example.com>\r\n```\r\n\r\ninto something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<a href=\"&#x6D;&#x61;i&#x6C;&#x74;&#x6F;:&#x61;&#x64;&#x64;&#x72;&#x65;\r\n&#115;&#115;&#64;&#101;&#120;&#x61;&#109;&#x70;&#x6C;e&#x2E;&#99;&#111;\r\n&#109;\">&#x61;&#x64;&#x64;&#x72;&#x65;&#115;&#115;&#64;&#101;&#120;&#x61;\r\n&#109;&#x70;&#x6C;e&#x2E;&#99;&#111;&#109;</a>\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich will render in a browser as a clickable link to “address@example.com”.\r\n\r\n(This sort of entity-encoding trick will indeed fool many, if not most, address-harvesting bots, but it definitely won’t fool all of them. It’s better than nothing, but an address published in this way will probably eventually start receiving spam.)\r\n\r\n### Backslash Escapes\r\n\r\nMarkdown allows you to use backslash escapes to generate literal characters which would otherwise have special meaning in Markdown’s formatting syntax. For example, if you wanted to surround a word with literal asterisks (instead of an HTML `<em>` tag), you can use backslashes before the asterisks, like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\\*literal asterisks\\*\r\n```\r\n\r\nMarkdown provides backslash escapes for the following characters:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\\   backslash\r\n`   backtick\r\n*   asterisk\r\n_   underscore\r\n{}  curly braces\r\n[]  square brackets\r\n()  parentheses\r\n#   hash mark\r\n+\tplus sign\r\n-\tminus sign (hyphen)\r\n.   dot\r\n!   exclamation mark\r\n```",

      "content": "==custom thunar actions\r\n\r\nI’ve included my custom actions [below](https://duncanlock.net/blog/2013/06/28/useful-thunar-custom-actions/#_rename_to_lower_case#_my_thunar_custom_actions) - and you can find [more around the web](https://www.google.com/search?q=thunar+custom+actions). I’ve only included ones here that aren’t commonly listed elsewhere.\r\n\r\n#### About Working Directories & Variables\r\n\r\n#### Working Directory\r\n\r\nThe current working directory for the a custom action, is the folder the Thunar window that launched the action, is currently displaying. You can test this by creating and running the following custom action:\r\n\r\n#### Test CWD\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n\r\nPrints out the current working directory\r\n\r\nCommand\r\n`pwd | zenity --text-info`  \r\n\r\nFile Pattern  \r\n\r\n`*`  \r\n\r\nAppears if selection contains\r\n\r\nDirectories\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n\r\n`sudo apt-get install zenity`\r\n\r\nThis means that you can use just filenames without a path in your custom actions to refer to a file in the current folder. This means that you can use the `%N` variable to process a list of selected files, instead if having to use the `%F` variable which includes the full pathname - this is handy for renaming just the files, without tampering with the pathname, for example.\r\n\r\n### Variables\r\n\r\nThunar custom actions can contain variable parameters, that get substituted with the actual value when you run the action. These allow you to refer to the files that are currently selected in Thunar when running your actions, without knowing in advance which ones. The following variables are available:\r\n\r\n| This… | is replaced at runtime with this… |\r\n| --- | --- |\r\n| %f | The path to the first selected file |\r\n| %F | The paths to all the selected files |\r\n| %d | Directory containing the file referred to by %f |\r\n| %D | Directories containing the files referred to by %F |\r\n| %n | The first selected filename, without the path |\r\n| %N | All the selected filenames, without paths |\r\n\r\nYou can see examples of these variables in use below.\r\n\r\n### My Thunar Custom Actions\r\n\r\nTo use these yourself, copy and paste these names, descriptions & commands into new actions in your Custom Actions Manager:\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n\r\nShares the currently selected folder, giving everyone read access.\r\n\r\nCommand\r\n\r\n`net usershare add %n %f \"\" Everyone:R guest_ok=y`\r\n\r\nFile Pattern\r\n\r\n`*`\r\n\r\nAppears if selection contains\r\n\r\nDirectories\r\n\r\n### Flatten Folder\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n\r\nMoves all files from sub-folders to parent (current) folder, then removes all empty folders inside the current folder.\r\n\r\nCommand\r\n\r\n`find . -mindepth 2 -type f -exec mv \"{}\" . \\; && find . -type d -empty -delete`\r\n\r\nFile Pattern\r\n\r\n`*`\r\n\r\nAppears if selection contains\r\n\r\nDirectories\r\n\r\n### Rename to lower-case\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n\r\nRename the currently selected files, making the filenames lower-case.\r\n\r\nCommand\r\n\r\n`for file in %N; do mv \"$file\" \"$(echo \"$file\" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')\"; done`\r\n\r\nFile Pattern\r\n\r\n`*`\r\n\r\nAppears if selection contains\r\n\r\n_All_\r\n\r\n### Slugify Filename\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n\r\nRename the currently selected files, making the filenames lower-case & replacing spaces with dashes.\r\n\r\nCommand\r\n\r\n`for file in %N; do mv \"$file\" \"$(echo \"$file\" | tr -s ' ' | tr ' A-Z' '-a-z' | tr -s '-' | tr -c '[:alnum:][:cntrl:].'

Then write this custom action:\r\n\r\nls -d %N | xclip -selection c \r\nAdditionally you can set an icon to the custom action, so you will find it easier later in the Thunar menu. This done and applied, when you select multiple files in Thunar (I usually select everything in a folder) and choose the action, the list of filenames will be on clipboard – without directory paths – ready for paste.\r\n\r\nList of Files into Editor\r\nCopy to clipboard is a kind of hidden action. If you are not good at remembering or checking what you last copied, then a more visible action may be in order. The list of filenames can be automatically opened up in a text editor, so you see the result of the action.\r\n\r\nThe problem here is that not every editor allows straightforward piping. The only one I found that does this is Leafpad. I am open to suggestions how other editors accept external input. With Leafpad, it works like this:\r\n\r\nls -d %N | leafpad \r\nWith every other editor, a possible solution is to output the list of filenames as a text file and then open the text file:\r\n\r\nls -d %N > filelist.txt && {editor} filelist.txt\r\nwhere {editor} is to be replaced with the name of the text editor. This is coarse and unelegant, but the file can be deleted by the end of the operation:\r\n\r\nls -d %N > filelist.txt && {editor} filelist.txt && rm filelist.txt \r\nThis will remove the text file as soon as the editor is closed.\r\n\r\nPCLOS Mag has a more extensive tutorial complete with examples of scripts and Zenity prompts http://pclosmag.com/html/Issues/201308/page02.html\r\n\r\nhttps://forums.bunsenlabs.org/viewtopic.php?id=7248\r\n\r\n",

It is a set of core tools inside Debian and Ubuntu Linux system. You can use the **apt command** to install, delete or remove apps, keep Ubuntu/Debian server up to date with security patches and more. Apt works with [dpkg](https://www.cyberciti.biz/howto/question/linux/dpkg-cheat-sheet.php) command cheat sheet for Debian and Ubuntu sysadmins to install and update the system. I strongly suggest that you use the apt command to save typing at the command line. This page provides apt command examples for new Linux users for package management purposes.  \r\n\r\n| apt command details | |\r\n--- | --- \r\n| Description | Advanced Package Tool \r\n| Category | Package Manager \r\n| Difficulty level | [Easy](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/tag/easy/ \"See all Easy Linux / Unix System Administrator Tutorials\") \r\n| Root privileges | [Yes](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/how-can-i-log-in-as-root/ \"See how to login as root user\") \r\n| Est. reading time | 10 minutes \r\n* * *\r\nIndex  \r\n1.

Conclusion  \r\n* * *\r\nThe [apt-get command](https://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/linux-debian-package-management-cheat-sheet.html \"Ubuntu/Debian Linux apt-get package management cheat sheet\") is the first front-end tool. apt is a second tool which overcomes some design mistakes of apt-get command. Hence you should use the apt command. This command provides nicer interface including progress bars and colors at the CLI. It provides the same functionality as the specialized APT tools, like apt-get and apt-cache, but enables options more suitable for interactive use by default.\r\n\r\n### apt command examples and purpose\r\n\r\n*Use apt for installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing apps/programs for a Debian or Ubuntu operating system in a consistent manner.*\r\n\r\n\r\n### Syntax\r\n\r\nThe basic syntax is as follows:\r\n\r\n`apt command`  \r\n`apt [options] command`  \r\n`apt [options] command pkg1`  \r\n`apt [options] command pkg1 pkg2`  \r\n\r\n### apt command examples\r\n\r\nLet us see how to use the apt command to install security updates or new set of packages on Ubuntu or Debian Linux server.\r\n\r\n### How to fetch updates\r\n\r\nTo download package information from all configured sources, enter:\r\n\r\n`sudo apt update`  \r\n\r\n### How to apply package and security updates\r\n\r\nTo upgrade all packages currently installed on the system, run:  \r\n\r\n`sudo apt upgrade`   \r\n\r\n*Please note that new packages will be installed if required to satisfy dependencies, but existing packages will never be removed.* \r\n\r\n### A note about applying package and security updates\r\n\r\nSimply type the following two commands to apply all security and package updates:\r\n\r\n`sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade`  \r\n\r\nSample output:  \r\n\r\n![gif](https://www.cyberciti.biz/media/new/images/faq/2016/02/lts-ubutnu-upgrade.gif)\r\n\r\nTo see the list of packages that can be upgraded on the system, enter:\r\n\r\n`apt list --upgradable`  \r\n\r\n![Fig.02: Ubuntu Linux 16.04 LTS list all upgradable packages apt command](https://www.cyberciti.biz/media/new/faq/2016/04/ubuntu-16.04-lts-list-upgradable-packages.jpg)\r\n\r\nFurther reading: [How to apply Debian security patches](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/how-does-debian-linux-apply-security-patches/)\r\n\r\n### How to perform full system upgrade\r\n\r\nThe full-upgrade command performs the function of upgrade but will remove currently installed packages if this is needed to upgrade the system as a whole. This is useful when packages are kept back from updates or you want to install from Ubuntu version 16.04 to 16.04.1:\r\n\r\n`sudo apt full-upgrade`\r\n\r\n### How to install a new packages\r\n\r\nTo install a new package called nginx, enter: \r\n\r\n`sudo apt install nginx`\r\n\r\n### How to remove a packages\r\n\r\nTo delete or remove a package called nginx, enter: \r\n\r\n`sudo apt remove nginx`  \r\n\r\nAll files are deleted except configuration files on the system.\r\n\r\n#### The purge option to remove both package and config files\r\n\r\nRemoving a package removes all packaged data, but leaves usually small (modified) user configuration files behind, in case the remove was an accident. Just issuing an installation request for the accidentally removed package will restore its function as before in that case. On the other hand you can get rid of these leftovers by calling purge even on already removed packages:  \r\n\r\n`sudo apt purge nginx`  \r\n`sudo apt purge nginx nginx-core nginx-common`   \r\n\r\n![apt command examples purging files](https://www.cyberciti.biz/media/new/faq/2016/04/apt-command-examples-purging-files.png)  \r\n\r\n#### The autoremove option\r\n\r\nThe autoremove option is used to remove packages that were automatically installed to satisfy dependencies for other packages and are now no longer needed as dependencies changed or the package(s) needing them were removed in the meantime. For example, when you upgrade Linux kernel to 4.1.5, you may not need Linux kernel version 3.8.5. \r\n\r\n`sudo apt autoremove`  \r\n`sudo apt --purge autoremove`  \r\n\r\n**Tip:** If you want to remove htop and install vim in one step, try:  \r\n\r\n`sudo apt remove htop vim+`  \r\n\r\nAnother way to do the same thing:  \r\n\r\n`sudo apt install htop- vim`  \r\n\r\nThe + (add) and - (remove) suffix to package names can override and flip an install/remove switch.

      "content": " The Standard cd Operations\r\n\r\nFor the sake of being complete, let's quickly run through the standard uses of cd.\r\n\r\nIf we're in the home directory, but want to change to one located at \"/usr/lib/firefox/browser\" instead, and then return to the home directory, we can use the following commands:\r\n\r\ncd /usr/lib/firefox/browser/\r\n\r\ncd /home/dave\r\n\r\ncd /usr/lib/firefox/browser/ in a terminal window\r\n\r\nYou don't have to type the whole directory path; you can use auto-complete. For each part of a path, after you type enough letters to distinguish the name of the directory from the others, press Tab to auto-complete the directory name.\r\n\r\nFor example, type the following on the command line:\r\n\r\ncd /usr/lib/fire\r\n\r\nNow, press Tab and the shell will fill in the rest of the \"firefox\" directory for you. If you add \"/b\" to the path and press Tab again, it adds the \"browser\" directory to the command.\r\n\r\nThe shell adds a trailing forward slash so you can repeat the tab-completion process. That's also why there's a trailing forward slash on the first command. There isn't one on the second because that one was typed.\r\n\r\nYou can use the tilde (~) as a shorthand way to quickly return to the home directory from anywhere in the filesystem; just type the following:\r\n\r\ncd ~\r\ncd ~ in a terminal window\r\n\r\nThese are examples of absolute paths, in which you provide the entire path from the root of the filesystem to the target directory, to cd.\r\n\r\nRelative paths are referenced from the current working directory. In the home directory, there's a directory called work. You can use the tree command to see the directory tree inside the work directory—just type the following:\r\n\r\ntree\r\n\r\ntree command in a terminal window\r\n\r\nThe work directory contains a directory called dev . There's also a directory called dev in the root directory of the filesystem. You can use ls with -d (directory) to look at each of these. The -hl (human-readable, long listing) option tells ls to use easy to read units for the directory sizes, and the long format listing.\r\n\r\nIf you type dev, the shell assumes you mean the \"dev\" in the current directory. To force it to look at the \"dev\" in the root directory, just add a leading forward slash to represent the root of the filesystem, as shown below:\r\n\r\nls -d dev -hl\r\n\r\nls -d /dev -hl\r\n\r\nls -d dev -hl in a terminal window\r\n\r\nThe cd command behaves like ls in this respect. If you reference the directory as dev, as shown below, it assumes you mean the directory in the work directory:\r\n\r\ncd dev\r\n\r\ncd dev in a terminal window\r\n\r\nWithout a leading forward slash, longer paths are assumed to start from the current working directory, too, as shown below:\r\n\r\ncd dev/mobile/android\r\n\r\ncd dev/mobile/android in a terminal window\r\nChanging the Directory with Double Dot\r\n\r\nThe double dot identifier represents the parent directory of the current working one. If you're in a deeply nested subdirectory, you can use .. with cd to move to the parent directory of the one you're in.\r\n\r\nThis moves you up two directories in the directory tree. If you add more .. onto the command, it allows you to move an arbitrary number of levels up the directory tree.\r\n\r\nType the following:\r\n\r\ncd ..\r\n\r\ncd ../..\r\n\r\ncd .. in a terminal window\r\n\r\nYou can also create a set of aliases to perform these maneuvers for you, by typing the following:\r\n\r\nalias .2=\"cd ../..\"\r\n\r\nalias .3=\"cd ../../..\"\r\n\r\nalias .2=\"cd ../..\" in a terminal window\r\n\r\nYou can use these in the same way as the commands themselves.\r\nalias .2=\"cd ../..\" being used to change directory in a terminal window\r\n\r\nTo make the aliases consistent across reboots of your computer, you must add them to your .bashrc or .bash_aliases file.\r\nEasily Hop Between Two Directories\r\n\r\nThe hyphen (-) is another symbol that has a special function. It changes your directory back to the one you just came from.\r\n\r\nFor this example, let's say you're in the \"c\" directory. You can use cd to change to the \"forth\" directory. Then, you can use cd - to bounce back and forth between the two directories.\r\n\r\nTo do this, you type the following:\r\n\r\n        \r\ncd ../forth\r\ncd -\r\ncd -\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nRunning 'cd ../forth' followed by two 'cd -' commands.\r\n\r\nThe name of the directory you're moving to appears before you move into it.\r\nAnother Kind of Relative\r\n\r\nThe shell uses the current working directory as the \"root\" or base directory for relative paths. You can use the CDPATH environment variable to set another location as the base directory for relative paths. If you spend most of your time in a certain section of the filesystem tree, this can save you a lot of keystrokes (and time) every day.\r\n\r\nLet's type the following to make work/dev/projects the base directory for relative paths:\r\n\r\nexport CDPATH=/home/dave/work/dev/projects\r\n\r\nRunning 'export CDPATH=/home/dave/work/dev/projects' in the Terminal.\r\n\r\nNow, each time you use the dc command, the location in the CDPATH environment variable is checked first for matching directory names. If any of them match the target you provided in the cd command, you're transferred to that directory.\r\n\r\nNow, regardless of where you are in the filesystem, when you use the cd command, the shell checks whether the target directory is located in the base directory. If it is, you're moved to that target directory.\r\n\r\nIf your target directory starts with a leading forward slash (/), which makes it an absolute path, it won't be affected by the CDPATH environment variable.\r\n\r\nTo demonstrate this, we type the following:\r\n\r\ncd c\r\n\r\ncd prolog\r\n\r\ncd /usr\r\n\r\ncd forth\r\n\r\nRunning a few different CD commands.\r\n\r\nThe CDPATH environment variable is truly a path, just like the PATH environment variable. When you type a command, the shell searches the locations in the PATH for a match. When you use CDPATH, the shell searches the locations in the CDPATH environment variable for a match. Also, the same as PATH, CDPATH can contain multiple locations.\r\n\r\nTo have the shell search the current directory before other locations in the CDPATH environment variable, you just add a period ( . ) at the beginning of the path like so:\r\n\r\n        \r\nexport CDPATH=.:/home/dave/work/dev/projects\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nTo make your settings permanent, you have to add them to a configuration file, such as .bashrc.\r\n\r\nOne thing to be aware of: If you set a base directory, it also affects directory changes performed within scripts. To avoid this, you can use absolute paths in your scripts or a test in your .bashrc file when you specify your CDPATH, as shown below:\r\n\r\n        \r\nif test \"${PS1+set}\"; then CDPATH=.:/home/dave/work/dev/projects; fi\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nThis performs a test to see whether the command-line prompt variable, $PS1 , was set. The CDPATH environment variable will only be set if the test succeeds.\r\nUsing shopt with cd\r\n\r\nWith the shopt command, you can set certain options for the shell. Some of these can enhance your use of cd. To set them, you use the -s (enable) option with shopt to pass an option name to it.\r\n\r\nThe cdspell option checks your directory names and corrects some common typing mistakes, including transposed or missing characters, or names with too many characters. If it finds a directory that matches any of the corrections, the corrected path is printed, and the cd action takes place.\r\n\r\nAs an example, we type the following to set the cdspell option and misspell \"Desktop\" to see if the shell corrects it for us:\r\n\r\nshopt -s cdspell\r\n\r\ncd Desktpo\r\n\r\nRun 'shopt -s cdspell' to enable Shell spellchecker.\r\n\r\nThe shell caught the error, corrected it, and changed to the \"Desktop\" directory.\r\n\r\nAnother shopt option you can use with cd is autocd. It eliminates the need for you to type cd at all. Anything you type that isn't a command, script, or other executable (such as an alias), is used as a target directory. If you can transfer to that directory, it's printed in the terminal window, and you're changed to that directory.\r\n\r\nAs an example, we type the following:\r\n\r\nshopt -s autocd\r\n\r\n/usr/local/games\r\n\r\n/etc\r\n\r\n~\r\n\r\nThe autocd command makes navigating quicker.\r\n\r\nSee! You can hop all over the filesystem without even using cd!\r\n\r\nThe settings you change with shopt only affect interactive shells, not scripts.\r\nThe cd Collection\r\n\r\nYou probably won't adopt all of these. However, it's likely you found something of interest or benefit here. After all, anything that speeds up or simplifies your command-line navigation is all good! ",

      "content": "Step 1 : Pull the fonts to your system\r\n\r\nTo pull a font archive from a publicly accessible server with a HTTP GET request, navigate to a directory of your choice and use cURL:\r\n\r\n$ curl -L -O https://github.com/source-foundry/Hack/releases/download/v3.003/Hack-v3.003-ttf.tar.gz\r\n\r\nStep 2 : Unpack the font archive\r\n\r\nUnpack the gzipped tar archive with tar:\r\n\r\n$ tar -xzvf Hack-v3.003-ttf.tar.gz\r\n\r\nFor the Hack fonts, this results in an unpacked directory path, ttf. The fonts are contained in the root of the directory. Archives from other typeface projects may result in a different unpacked path structure. If you are installing a different set of fonts, review the font paths before you move on to the next step.\r\nStep 3 : Install the fonts\r\n\r\nOn Linux systems, font binaries are generally installed in either the system font directory on the path /usr/share/fonts/ or in a user font directory that is frequently on one of the following paths: ~/.local/share/fonts/ or /usr/local/share/fonts. We’ll use the ~/.local/share/fonts/ path in this example. If the directory does not exist, create it with the following command:\r\n\r\n$ mkdir ~/.local/share/fonts\r\n\r\nMove your font binaries to the destination directory with mv:\r\n\r\n$ mv ttf/Hack-Regular.ttf ~/.local/share/fonts/Hack-Regular.ttf\r\n$ mv ttf/Hack-Italic.ttf ~/.local/share/fonts/Hack-Italic.ttf\r\n$ mv ttf/Hack-Bold.ttf ~/.local/share/fonts/Hack-Bold.ttf\r\n$ mv ttf/Hack-BoldItalic.ttf ~/.local/share/fonts/Hack-BoldItalic.ttf\r\n\r\nStep 4 : Clear and regenerate your font cache\r\n\r\nNext, clear and regenerate your font cache with the following command:\r\n\r\n$ fc-cache -f -v\r\n\r\nYou will see a stream of text as the font cache is created. This can be a lengthy body of text if you have a large number of fonts installed on your system. If you examine the text closely, you should see that your new font installs were identified during this process.\r\nStep 5 : Verify the installation\r\n\r\nConfirm that the fonts are installed by displaying the paths and style definitions with the fc-list executable filtered on the font family name with grep:\r\n\r\n$ fc-list | grep \"Hack\"\r\n\r\nOn my system, the following text is displayed:\r\n\r\n/home/chris/.local/share/fonts/Hack-BoldItalic.ttf: Hack:style=Bold Italic\r\n/home/chris/.local/share/fonts/Hack-Italic.ttf: Hack:style=Italic\r\n/home/chris/.local/share/fonts/Hack-Bold.ttf: Hack:style=Bold\r\n/home/chris/.local/share/fonts/Hack-Regular.ttf: Hack:style=Regular\r\n\r\nThe fonts are now installed and ready for use.\r\nStep 6 : Cleanup\r\n\r\nThe archive file and unpacked directory are no longer necessary. Let’s remove them:\r\n\r\n$ rm -rf ttf && rm Hack-v3.003-ttf.tar.gz\r\n\r\nAll Together Now\r\n\r\nWe provide a shell script for Hack font installs that pulls these steps together into a single command for our Linux users.\r\n\r\nThe command to manually install version 3.003 of our fonts looks like this:\r\n\r\n$ ./hack-linux-intaller.sh v3.003\r\n\r\nTo upgrade the fonts, users increment the version number in the command as new releases are pushed to the Github repository.\r\n\r\nA Github gist of the script source follows. If you followed along above you will notice that the commands are identical to the examples in the steps that we just reviewed.\r\n\r\n    Step 1 is on line 42\r\n        Step 2 is on line 47\r\n            Step 3 is on lines 61–71\r\n                Step 4 is on line 81\r\n                    Step 5 is on line 85\r\n                        Step 6 is on lines 58 & 75\r\n\r\n                        The script is MIT licensed and can be modified by typeface developers and users to support simple initial installs and upgrades for other projects that release in a similar way.\r\n                        Uninstall Fonts on Linux\r\n\r\n                        The process to uninstall fonts requires identification of the installation paths, removal of the font binaries, and regeneration of the font cache. The font removal step is the only new task that you need to learn if you went through the installation steps in the section above. Be aware that the removal of font binaries with rm step eliminates the files permanently. Please consider backups if they are not readily accessible in the future and you might have a need for them again!\r\n                        Step 1 : Identify the font binary paths\r\n\r\n                        Use the fc-list executable with grep to identify the paths to the installed fonts by family name:\r\n\r\n                        $ fc-list | grep \"Hack\"\r\n\r\n                        Modify the grep search term to identify other font families.\r\n                        Step 2: Remove the font binaries\r\n\r\n                        Use the rm executable to remove the installed font binaries on the paths that you identified with the command in Step 1. This permanently deletes the files. Use caution (and backup copies somewhere!) if the files are not readily accessible should you need them again.\r\n\r\n                        If you used the installation steps above to install the Hack fonts, the following command will remove the fonts:\r\n\r\n                        $ rm \"$HOME/.local/share/fonts/Hack-*.ttf\"\r\n\r\n                        Step 3: Clear and regenerate the font cache\r\n\r\n                        Then regenerate your font cache:\r\n\r\n                        $ fc-cache\r\n\r\n                        And that is a manual font management round trip on the Linux command line. Enjoy the many new typeface options that are available to you on your Linux box!",

What is yt-dlp?\r\n\r\nYT-DLP is a free and open-source software project created (as a fork) from the now-discontinued project, youtube-dlc. yt-dlp is based on the popular YouTube downloader, youtube-dlc, but now comes with additional features and improvements. This software is basically used to download videos from YouTube, Vimeo, and other similar websites. \r\n\r\nDownloading and installing yt-dlp is relatively easy, but learning how to use it properly, can take some time. YT-DLP is a command-line tool used on Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems. Having no “beautiful” front-end GUI puts many people off, yet it is the most potent youtube downloader available. \r\nWhat are YT-DLP’s main features? \r\n\r\n    Network Options: Change how yt-dlp communicates with the network. This includes options such as setting a proxy, adjusting the timeout value, and specifying the user agent string.\r\n    Bypass Geo Restriction: This feature allows you to bypass geographical restrictions that may prevent you from accessing specific videos based on location. You can use yt-dlp options with a VPN or a proxy to get around these restrictions.\r\n    Video Selection: With yt-dlp, you can select the videos you want to download from a playlist or channel. In addition, you can also download entire playlists and channels. \r\n    Download Options: This feature allows you to control the downloading process. You can, for example, choose to download only audio, only video, or both. You can also set the video quality and download speed limits.\r\n    Filesystem Options: With this feature, you can specify the output directory and filename templates for downloaded videos.\r\n    Thumbnail Images: Download thumbnail images for videos along with the video itself. You can even specify the image format and size.\r\n    Workarounds: This feature provides various workarounds for issues arising during the download process. For example, you can use the –no-check-certificate option to bypass SSL certificate verification. \r\n    Automatic retries for failed downloads. By default, yt-dlp will make three attempts to download a video before giving up and moving on to the next one. You can also configure this number of retries.\r\n    Video Format Options: Yt-dlp lets you choose the video format you want to download, such as MP4, WebM, or FLV. You can also set the video quality and resolution.\r\n    Subtitle Features: This yt-dlp option allows you to download subtitles (embed them) along with the video. You can specify the subtitle format and language.\r\n    Authentication Options: Authenticate with certain websites, such as YouTube or Vimeo. You can use options such as username and password or API key to authenticate.\r\n    Post-processing Options: Perform various post-processing tasks on downloaded videos, such as merging or splitting video files, adding metadata, or converting the video to a different format.\r\n    Integrates with SponsorBlock: This feature enables you to mark/remove sponsor sections in YouTube videos through the SponsorBlock API.\r\n\r\n2. How to download and install YT-DLP?\r\n\r\n    Go to yt-dlp official GitHub repository: https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp\r\n    Scroll down to the bottom of the page, where the download button is visible. This internal (anchor) link will take you to: https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#installation.\r\n\r\ndownloading and installing Yt-dlp\r\nPhoto by Github\r\n\r\n    On this installation page, scroll down and find the latest release files. Locate the executable files, yt-dlp (zip import binary recommended for Linux or BSD), yt-dlp.exe (for Windows), or yt-dlp_macOS (for Windows). If your OS does not support any of these release files, scroll down on this page ‘alternatives’ to find more options. \r\n    Choose your platform or Operating system and download the appropriate release file. \r\n\r\ndownloading and installing Yt-dlp\r\nPhoto by Github\r\na. Downloading and Installing yt-dlp on Windows.\r\n\r\n    For illustration purposes, we will download and run yt-dlp.exe for a Windows 2022 Server. \r\n    Once downloaded, verify the size, version, and company. Take a look at the screenshot below.\r\n\r\ndownloading and installing Yt-dlp\r\n\r\nNote: The yt-dlp.exe file is not an installer; it’s the executable file for yt-dlp itself. In the context of Windows, an executable file (with an .exe extension) is a program that can run directly once it’s clicked or executed from the command line. For yt-dlp, you simply place the yt-dlp.exe file in a directory of your choice (for instance C:\\ytdlp) and run it directly from there.\r\nb. Downloading and Installing yt-dlp in Linux (Ubuntu).\r\n\r\n    For illustration purposes, we will download and install the latest release of yt-dlp in Ubuntu 22.04. Ensure your Ubuntu machine is up to date. \r\n    The following command downloads the latest release of the yt-dlp program from GitHub and installs it in the /usr/local/bin directory with the filename yt-dlp. \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n$ sudo wget https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/latest/download/yt-dlp -O /usr/local/bin/yt-dlp\r\ndownloading and installing Yt-dlp\r\n\r\n    The following  command sets the permissions of the yt-dlp file in the /usr/local/bin directory to allow all users (owner, group, and others) to read and execute the file. \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n$ sudo chmod a+rx /usr/local/bin/yt-dlp\r\n\r\n    This command is necessary to allow users to run the yt-dlp command from the command line.\r\n\r\ndownloading and installing Yt-dlp\r\n3. Installing Dependencies: FFmpeg and FFProbe\r\n\r\nBefore moving on with yt-dlp, it is highly recommended that you install FFmpeg and FFprobe. There are other ‘optional’ dependencies regarding the network, metadata, and miscellaneous, but FFmpeg and FFProbe are almost “mandatory”\r\n\r\n    FFmpeg is a multimedia framework for handling video, audio, and other multimedia files. It is used by yt-dlp to perform various multimedia operations, including merging different formats of video or audio files.  Without it, yt-dlp won’t be able to merge requested formats. For instance, you may download a 1080p video without audio. \r\n\r\n    FFProbe is the command-line tool that comes with FFmpeg. FFProbe is used to analyze and extract information from multimedia files such as video and audio. Yt-dlp needs to use FFProbe to extract metadata from the multimedia files being downloaded. This metadata includes information such as the video or audio codec, the resolution, the duration, the bit rate, and other technical details about the multimedia file. Without FFprobe, yt-dlp would not be able to extract this metadata, and some of its features may not work correctly.\r\n\r\ndownloading and installing Yt-dlp's dependencies\r\nPhoto by Github\r\n\r\n    Before installing FFmpeg and FFProbe, ensure that your machine is up to date.\r\n\r\na. Installing FFmpeg and FFprobe on Linux.\r\n\r\nTo install FFmpeg on a Linux machine (Ubuntu 22.04), use the following command: \r\n\t\r\n\r\n$ sudo apt install ffmpeg\r\n\r\n    To check the installation and current version, use the following command: \r\n\r\ndownloading and installing Yt-dlp's dependencies\r\n\r\nFFprobe installation? FFprobe comes when you install the  FFmpeg package. There is no need to do additional installation for FFprobe. To test whether FFprobe is installed, issue the “ffprobe” command:\r\ndownloading and installing Yt-dlp's dependencies\r\nb. Installing FFmpeg and FFprobe on Windows\r\n\r\n    Go to https://ffmpeg.org/ and download the package (.EXE file) for Windows. Release builds are usually more stable than Git Master build, which are released more often \r\n    Choose your release, download the 7z or zip file and uncrompress it. \r\n\r\ndownloading and installing Yt-dlp's dependencies\r\nPhoto by Github\r\n\r\n    Download the package and save it anywhere you want.\r\n    We created a new folder called “PATH_Programs-ytdpl” where we will move and unzip the FFmpeg package. \r\n    Under ffmpeg-(name of the file) > bin > you’ll see the three tools: ffmpeg, ffplay, and ffprobe. Move (unzip) the three applications to your new folder. \r\n\r\ndownloading and installing Yt-dlp's dependencies\r\n\r\n    Record the path (for example: C:\\PATH_Programs -ytdlp) and head over to “Edit the system environment variables.” This Windows utility allows you to modify the environment variables that are used by the operating system and applications running on your computer. The PATH environment variable we will define next specifies a list of directories that the operating system should search when looking for executable files.\r\n    To open this, go to the search bar on Windows and type “path”\r\n\r\ndownloading and installing Yt-dlp's dependencies\r\n\r\n    In System Properties > Advanced, head over to “Environment Variables”\r\n\r\ndownloading and installing Yt-dlp's dependencies\r\n\r\n    In Environment Variables, under “User variables for Administrators” choose Path (1) > then click on “Edit”. \r\n\r\ndownloading and installing Yt-dlp's dependencies\r\n\r\n    The new “Edit Enviromnet variable” window will open. Click on New (1) > Enter the Path where FFmpeg is stored (2) > Click on Ok (3). \r\n\r\ndownloading and installing Yt-dlp's dependencies\r\n\r\n    Now, whenever you want to run FFmpeg from any folder or location, the computer will know where it is and allow you to use it. \r\n    Now, test the FFmpeg configuration from the Windows command prompt. Open the “cmd” and type ‘ffmpeg’. You should get an output such as the one below. \r\n\r\ndownloading and installing Yt-dlp's dependencies\r\n\r\n    FFprobe comes with the FFmpeg installation (as you might have noticed above). To test FFprove, do the same as ffmpeg. Simply go to the command prompt and type ‘ffprobe’.\r\n\r\n\r\nReady to Boost Your Downloads with Seedbox?\r\n\r\nDiscover how RapidSeedbox enhances your YT-DLP experience with: Fast & Secure Downloads, Easy Streaming, Ample Storage, and 24/7 Access\r\n\r\n———\r\n4. How to use YT-DLP in Windows and Linux.\r\n\r\nAs you might already know, yt-dlp is a command-line tool, so to use it (in Windows or Linux), you will have to go through the command prompt or terminal. If you have already downloaded, and installed it along with its dependencies, go ahead and open your terminal. \r\n\r\nDisclaimer: Downloading videos from YouTube using tools like yt-dlp may potentially infringe upon the terms of service, copyrights, and intellectual property rights of content creators. It is important to recognize and comply with the applicable laws and regulations regarding the downloading and distribution of copyrighted material in your jurisdiction. This note does not constitute legal advice and should not be relied upon as such.\r\na. How to use yt-dlp in Windows? \r\n\r\n    Yt-dlp runs on the command line (it has no frontend GUI). When you run it from the cmd.exe for the first time (without any arguments), you will notice an error message (such as the following): “yt-dlp.exe: error: You must provide at least one URL”\r\n\r\nusing Yt-dlp\r\n\r\n    Let’s go ahead and access the help menu. To see a list of all the options, use type the “yt-dlp –help” command. A menu such as the following will appear in your terminal (or command prompt):\r\n\r\nusing Yt-dlp\r\n\r\n    To use yt-dlp, ensure you are in the same location where yt-dlp.exe is, and use it with “yt-dlp (following the youtube URL), for instance: \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\nyt-dlp https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PmJeP-TphM\r\nusing Yt-dlp\r\n\r\n    Yt-dlp allows you to use arguments to empower you with more options when downloading your youtube videos. \r\n    For example, you can tell yt-dlp exactly the format you want and how to download it. To do this, you might have to first find out what formats are available: Use the following command:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\nyt-dlp -F --list-formats https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PmJeP-TphM\r\nusing Yt-dlp\r\n\r\n    Now, you might want to download a youtube video (i.e.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PmJeP-TphM) with the format (-f) best quality video and best audio available (with specific format); to do this use the following command:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\nyt-dlp -f “bestvideo&#91;ext=mp4]+bestaudio&#91;ext=m4a]” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PmJeP-TphM\r\nusing Yt-dlp\r\n\r\n    To learn more about these arguments and how to use them properly, use the yt-dlp –help” command. \r\n    And that’s it; we downloaded two youtube videos using yt-dlp.\r\n\r\nusing Yt-dlp\r\nb. yt-dlp commands for Linux\r\n\r\n    Same as Windows, in Ubuntu Linux, if you type yt-dlp [without arguments] in the terminal console, you’ll get an error message. \r\n\r\nusing Yt-dlp\r\n\r\n    If need to see the yt-dlp help menu, use the following command yt-dlp –help\r\n    If you want to download a youtube video with the best quality video and best audio available, use the following command:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\nyt-dlp -f 'bv*+ba' https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PmJeP-TphM\r\nusing Yt-dlp\r\n\r\nNote: If you see the following WARNING message: “You have requested merging of multiple formats (of video and audio), but FFmpeg is not installed. The formats won’t be merged.” it means that you have not yet installed FFmpeg… To learn how to install FFmpeg, go back to the section (installing FFmpeg). \r\n\r\n    Now, what if you want to download a specific format for your youtube video? A useful Format command is the “-F –list-formats.” For example, we would like to list the available formats on the video > \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\nyt-dlp -F --list-formats https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PmJeP-TphM\r\nusing Yt-dlp\r\n\r\n    For example, from the above output, you can see that this youtube video is available for download with video and audio at the resolutions 144p, 360p, and 720p. Now, let’s specify which format we want to download. \r\n    We will use another video as an example. First (as shown before) see the available formats and then use the command “-f ‘bv*[height=…]+ba’” to specify the format. For instance, \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\nyt-dlp -F --list-formats https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jw9W7kUBFk\r\n\t\r\n\r\nyt-dlp -f 'bv*&#91;height=720]+ba' https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jw9W7kUBFk\r\nusing Yt-dlp\r\n\r\n    Using the above set of commands will help you be more specific about which youtube video format you would want to download. Instead of downloading the highest (4K, for example), you can specify the audio and video format. \r\n    In addition, you’ll notice that the FFmpeg WARNING message is not showing. This is because at this point, we already have installed FFmpeg correctly. \r\n\r\n5. Advanced uses for Plugin yt-dlp.\r\n\r\nBelow we will show you two more advanced uses for the yt-dlp plugin. We will show you these examples on Linux.  \r\na. Configuring the yt-dlp.conf file. \r\n\r\nThe plugin yt-dlp also offers the option to establish a range of defaults that it will automatically implement, including a preferred video format such as mkv, mp4, webm, etc. To create a configuration file that yt-dlp can use, enter supported commands into the configuration file. The config file can be loaded from the system (/etc/yt-dlp.conf), user configuration, home configuration, portable or main configuration. \r\n\r\n    Open (or create) the yt-dlp.conf from your terminal using the text editor: \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\nsudo vim /etc/yt-dlp.conf\r\n\r\n    Or \r\n\r\n    The below configuration file is an example (but you can customize it to your own preferences). Using the below configuration, yt-dlp will automatically save all videos in a particular path (/Youtube) and renames them to the Title.extension. By default, yt-dlp saves youtube videos to its default path and gives the URL as the main title. \r\n\r\nThe configuration will also embed a thumbnail, metadata, and English subtitles. \r\nusing Yt-dlp\r\n\r\n    Now let’s try our brand new yt-dlp configuration: \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\nyt-dlp https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8HY1aVzZDM\r\nusing Yt-dlp\r\n\r\nWith this configuration file, you can automate your entire youtube download process. This saves you time, as you no longer have to enter configuration for each line of video download. The configuration file will use your personalized download format for the process.\r\n\r\nNote (For Windows users): It is recommended to put this config file in “${APPDATA}/yt-dlp/config” and save it as .txt. The AppData folder is under “C:\\Users\\<user name>\\AppData\\” and is usually a hidden folder. Setting configuration lines in this config file is similar to what we did with Linux in this section.\r\nb. Use Bashrc files. \r\n\r\nAnother way you can optimize your download process with yt-dlp is to use bashrc files. These files contain shell (command-line interface) settings for the Bash shell. The bashrc file is executed every time a new terminal session is opened, and it can be used to configure various settings and aliases for the shell. The bashrc file can be very useful for yt-dlp, because you can use it to set up aliases or shell functions that simplify the usage of yt-dlp. For example, you can create an alias that automatically downloads a video in your preferred format and quality by typing a single command in the terminal. This can save you time and make it easier to use yt-dlp regularly.\r\n\r\n    To locate the .bashrc (in Ubuntu) go to home/ubunu > .bashrc\r\n\r\nusing Yt-dlp\r\n\r\n    Open the .bashrc with any of the following text editors. \r\n\r\nOr,\r\n\r\n    Enter the bashrc aliases for yt-dlp that you would like. For example:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n# yt-dlp aliases\r\n\r\nalias ydl='yt-dlp'\r\n\r\nalias ydlmp4='yt-dlp -f \"bestvideo&#91;ext=mp4]+bestaudio&#91;ext=m4a]/best&#91;ext=mp4]/best\"'\r\n\r\nalias ydlmkv='yt-dlp -f \"bestvideo&#91;ext=mkv]+bestaudio&#91;ext=mka]/best&#91;ext=mkv]/best\"'\r\nusing Yt-dlp\r\n\r\n    To activate the aliases, either close and reopen the terminal window or run the following command:\r\n\r\n    Now, let’s test our alias. This should make our lives easier when downloading youtube videos with yt-dlp. Use an alias; for example, by entering “ydlmp4” you are saving yourself on writing long commands such as bestvideo[ext=mp4]+bestaudio[ext=m4a]/best[ext=mp4]/best\r\n    There are many things happening now! As you can see from the below output… Our alias is working, the configuration is trying to embed thumbnails, subtitles, metadata, etc. Plus, the video is being saved in (and with) /Youtube/%(title)s.%(ext)s – where the title is the name of the video rather than the URL. \r\n\r\nusing Yt-dlp\r\nc. Manage and download large amounts of data with yt-dlp into a seedbox. \r\n\r\nIf you download and manage large amounts of data with yt-dlp, then a seedbox can be a fantastic solution. A seedbox is a remote VPS or dedicated server designed for anonymous download and upload of digital files, such as torrents, NZBs, videos, and music. Plus, since seedboxes are designed for downloading and uploading, they usually offer high speeds. \r\n\r\nFor instance, you can remotely connect to your seedbox and use its powerful resources to download videos with yt-dlp. Seedboxes also offer streaming platforms like Plex or Kodi and other wonderful ways to manage your media collection. Plus, if you decide later to change the format, compress, or encode, seedboxes also come with robust media converters like Handbrake. You can later download all your media content easily with FTP or Sync protocols.\r\n\r\nThis combination allows fast and efficient downloads and easy management of all your downloaded content.\r\n6. yt-dlp: Pros and Cons\r\n\r\nAlthough yt-dlp has many great features and characteristics that make it one of the best youtube downloaders, it also has a few disadvantages that you should know about. Here are some pros and cons of using yt-dlp.\r\na. Pros:\r\n\r\n    Free and open-source: yt-dlp is 100% free. It is also an open-source project maintained by a solid community of developers.\r\n    Multi-platform support: yt-dlp is available for Windows, Linux, and macOS. This multi-platform support makes it accessible to a wide range of users.\r\n    Variety of download options: Although yt-dlp is one of the best for what it does, “download youtube videos,” it also has additional options that are hard to see in other video downloaders. These download options include video format, subtitle selection, and thumbnail images.\r\n    Automatic retries: yt-dlp has some fantastic automation capabilities. One of the best features it that it can automatically retry failed downloads, saving you time and effort.\r\n    Support for more sites and extensions: yt-dlp supports more sites other than youtube, including Vimeo and Youku. It also supports browser extensions like SponsorBlock, to allow you to skip sponsored segments in YouTube videos.\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n\r\n    No GUI: One turndown for many people when using yt-dlp is the lack of GUI. yt-dlp is a command-line tool, which may not be ideal for users who prefer a graphical user interface.\r\n    Configuration required: As you might have noticed from our step-by-step guide to configure and use yt-dlp, the tool requires some knowledge for its configuration. To use yt-dlp, you must learn the configuration lines to get the desired output format, audio quality, or other options. \r\n    No official packages: yt-dlp does not have official packages for some platforms. If you have the skills and the patience to build it from a source or rely on third-party repositories, then having no official package may not disadvantage you. \r\n    Legal concerns: Downloading Youtube videos is technically against their Terms of Service. So literally, the company could sue you. Still, many users decide to do so, and the company has shown no desire to penalize users for downloading their videos. However, it is still vital for you to be aware of the legal implications of downloading copyrighted material.\r\n\r\n7.

      "content": "10 handy systemd commands\r\n\r\n### List unit files\r\n\r\nFrom the `systemd` man page: A unit file is a plain text ini-style file that encodes information about a service, a socket, a device, a mount point, an automount point, a swap file or partition, a start-up target, a watched file system path, a timer controlled and supervised by `systemd`, a resource management slice, or a group of externally created processes.\r\n\r\n```\r\nsystemctl list-unit-files\r\n\r\nUNIT FILE                                                     STATE\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------   \r\nproc-sys-fs-binfmt_misc.automount         static\r\ndev-hugepages.mount                                static\r\ndev-mqueue.mount                                     static\r\nproc-sys-fs-binfmt_misc.mount                 static\r\nsys-fs-fuse-connections.mount                 static\r\nsys-kernel-config.mount                             static\r\nsys-kernel-debug.mount                            static\r\ntmp.mount                                               disabled\r\nbrandbot.path                                         disabled\r\nsystemd-ask-password-console.path        static  \r\nsystemd-ask-password-plymouth.path     static  \r\nsystemd-ask-password-wall.path               static  \r\nsession-1.scope                                              static\r\narp-ethers.service                                    disabled\r\nauditd.service                                            enabled\r\nautovt@.service                                         enabled\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nOf course, you can always pipe to `grep` to see just the enabled services.\r\n\r\n```\r\nsystemctl list-unit-files |grep enabled\r\n\r\nauditd.service                                                         enabled\r\nautovt@.service                                                      enabled\r\ncrond.service                                                           enabled\r\ndbus-org.fedoraproject.FirewallD1.service        enabled\r\ndbus-org.freedesktop.nm-dispatcher.service    enabled\r\nfirewalld.service                                                       enabled\r\ngetty@.service                                                          enabled\r\nirqbalance.service                                                    enabled\r\nkdump.service                                                          enabled\r\nlvm2-monitor.service                                               enabled\r\n\r\n<many more entries>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese unit files, located under `/lib/systemd/system`, are roughly equivalent to the legacy init scripts that were located under `/etc/rc.d/init.d`. In fact, if you or your software installation create init scripts, a corresponding `systemd` unit file is mapped for you. A further explanation is given by `/etc/rc.d/init.d/README`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nYou are looking for the traditional init scripts in /etc/rc.d/init.d,\r\nand they are gone?\r\n\r\nHere's an explanation on what's going on:\r\n\r\nYou are running a systemd-based OS where traditional init scripts have\r\nbeen replaced by native systemd services files. Service files provide\r\nvery similar functionality to init scripts. To make use of service\r\nfiles simply invoke \"systemctl\", which will output a list of all\r\ncurrently running services (and other units). Use \"systemctl\r\nlist-unit-files\" to get a listing of all known unit files, including\r\nstopped, disabled and masked ones. Use \"systemctl start\r\nfoobar.service\" and \"systemctl stop foobar.service\" to start or stop a\r\nservice, respectively. For further details, please refer to\r\nsystemctl(1).\r\n\r\nNote that traditional init scripts continue to function on a systemd\r\nsystem. An init script /etc/rc.d/init.d/foobar is implicitly mapped\r\ninto a service unit foobar.service during system initialization.\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nFurther reading:\r\n        man:systemctl(1)\r\n        man:systemd(1)\r\n        http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/systemd-for-admins-3.html\r\n        http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/Incompatibilities\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see, `init.d` has been removed in favor of `systemd`. It's here to stay until someone comes up with something better. (I'm hoping that someone is rapidly working on a replacement.)\r\n\r\n### List units\r\n\r\nListing active units displays a lot of useful information about your loaded and active services. The output is too detailed to demonstrate here, but try the following command on your system to see what I mean.\r\n\r\n```\r\nsystemctl list-units\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe status fields are great to see, but the description field is the most useful to me. It provides detailed information about your services.\r\n\r\n### Start a service\r\n\r\nTo get a service name, list your unit files and grep for the one you want. Then use the `systemctl` command to start your service. I'm using `firewalld` as the example.\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo systemctl start firewalld\r\n```\r\n\r\nSurprisingly, or maybe not so surprisingly, there's no response from starting, stopping, or restarting a service. To check the status of a service, you must use the status command.\r\n\r\n### Checking a service status\r\n\r\nTo check a service's status, use the `systemctl status service-name` command.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ sudo systemctl status sshd\r\n[sudo] password for khess: \r\n● sshd.service - OpenSSH server daemon\r\n   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/sshd.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)\r\n   Active: active (running) since Wed 2020-04-29 07:44:57 CDT; 2h 17min ago\r\n     Docs: man:sshd(8)\r\n           man:sshd_config(5)\r\n Main PID: 1055 (sshd)\r\n   CGroup: /system.slice/sshd.service\r\n           └─1055 /usr/sbin/sshd -D\r\n\r\nApr 29 07:44:57 centos7 systemd[1]: Starting OpenSSH server daemon...\r\nApr 29 07:44:57 centos7 sshd[1055]: Server listening on 0.0.0.0 port 22.\r\nApr 29 07:44:57 centos7 sshd[1055]: Server listening on :: port 22.\r\nApr 29 07:44:57 centos7 systemd[1]: Started OpenSSH server daemon.\r\nApr 29 07:51:35 centos7 sshd[1396]: Accepted password for khess from 192.168.1.85 port 56769 ssh2\r\n```\r\n\r\nI like systemd's status because of the detail given. For example, in the above listing, you see the full path to the unit file, the status, the start command, and the latest status changes.\r\n\r\n### Stop a service\r\n\r\nStopping a running service is as easy as starting one.\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo systemctl stop firewalld\r\n```\r\n\r\nAgain, you see no response from issuing this command. Issue a service status to check your success or failure.\r\n\r\n### Restarting a service\r\n\r\nIf you want to stop and start a service without issuing two commands (sysadmins are a lazy lot, after all), issue a restart.\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo systemctl restart firewalld\r\n```\r\n\r\nNo system response is displayed.\r\n\r\n### System restart, halt, and shutdown\r\n\r\nThese three tasks are typical ones that sysadmins need to know and are now under the control of `systemd`.\r\n\r\n### Reboot\r\n\r\nThere are multiple ways to restart your systems, but the old standby, reboot, is actually a link to the `systemctl` command. I assume that since it works, it links the `systemctl` command with the reboot switch added as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo systemctl reboot\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe same link applies to the halt and to the shutdown commands.\r\n\r\n### Shutdown and halt\r\n\r\nIt doesn't matter how you used to do it with `halt -p` or `shutdown now` or whatever, the universal command is now:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo systemctl poweroff\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis command powers down the system.\r\n\r\n#### Set services to run at boot time\r\n\r\nYou're used to the `chkconfig` command to enable your services to run at boot time and under a particular runlevel. Well, those days too are gone, and they have been usurped by the ubiquitous `systemctl` command.\r\n\r\n### Enabling a service to run at boot time\r\n\r\nTo set any service to start at boot, issue the following command. I'm using `firewalld` as the example service.\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo systemctl enable firewalld\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Disabling a service from running at boot time\r\n\r\nTo prevent any service from starting at boot time, issue:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo systemctl disable firewalld\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `firewalld` service will not start at boot time.\r\n\r\n### Wrap up\r\n\r\nThis brief but handy `systemd/systemctl` reference guide should take some of the pain out of dealing with `systemd`. That's the theory, at least. And, as you'll often see in my articles or hear me say out loud, \"Everything works on paper.\" Be sure to let me know on Twitter what you think of my articles and also to suggest new topics.",

      "content": "## Install Gammy on Linux (X11 only)\r\n\r\n  \r\nIf you're a Windows user, you can [download Gammy](https://getgammy.com/downloads.html) from its website. On Linux though, you'll have to build Gammy from source (see below).  \r\n  \r\n\\[Update\\] Gammy is [now available via AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/gammy-git/) for easier Arch Linux installation.  \r\n  \r\n1\\. Install the packages required to build Gammy on Linux (Mesa-libgl and Qt5), as well as Git to get the latest code of the app.  \r\n  \r\nOn Debian/Ubuntu or Fedora you can install these packages as follows:  \r\n  \r\n\r\n*   Debian / Ubuntu / Linux Mint / Pop!\\_OS, etc.:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo apt install git build-essential libgl1-mesa-dev qt5-default libxxf86vm-dev libxext-dev\r\n```\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n*   Fedora (not tested; note that Fedora uses Wayland by default, which is not supported by Gammy; you'll need to login to an Xorg session to use it):\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo dnf install git mesa-libGL-devel qt5-devel libXxf86vm-devel libXext-devel\r\n```\r\n\r\n  \r\n2\\. Build and install Gammy (from Git):  \r\n  \r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/Fushko/gammy.git\r\ncd gammy\r\nqmake Gammy.pro\r\nmake\r\nsudo make install\r\n```\r\n\r\n  \r\nOn some Linux distributions, if you get an error message saying `qmake: command not found`, even though Qt5 (devel) is installed, you'll have to run `qmake-qt5 Gammy.pro` instead of `qmake Gammy.pro`.  \r\n  \r\nAlso, on some Linux distributions (e.g. Ubuntu 18.04, but not on Ubuntu 19.04), you may get an error when running `qmake Gammy.pro`, with a message complaining about an element called \"PlaceholderText\" - in such cases the Gammy readme mentions opening `ui_mainwindow.h` with a text editor and deleting the offending lines (the line numbers should be shown when you get the error).  \r\n  \r\nThe Gammy executable is installed to `/opt/gammy/bin`, so you'll need to type `/opt/gammy/bin/gammy` to run it. You can make a symbolic link for `/opt/gammy/bin/gammy` to `/usr/local/bin/` so you can launch it by typing only the executable name, by using:  \r\n  \r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo ln -s /opt/gammy/bin/gammy /usr/local/bin/\r\n```\r\n\r\n  \r\nAfter this you'll be able to launch Gammy by typing `gammy` in a terminal or run dialog (`Alt + F2`). You will not find Gammy in your applications menu!  \r\n  \r\n3\\. \\[Optional\\] Add Gammy to startup.  \r\n  \r\nIn most cases you'll want Gammy running on startup, so it automatically adjusts your screen brightness as soon as you login. Add it to startup by opening Startup Applications (or equivalent) from your applications menu, click `Add` to add a new startup item, and use this as the command: `/opt/gammy/bin/gammy` (you may also use just \"gammy\" if you created a symbolic link for it somewhere in your `$PATH`).  \r\n  \r\nYou can also do this manually, by creating a file called `gammy.desktop` in `~/.config/autostart/` with the following contents:  \r\n  \r\n\r\n```\r\n[Desktop Entry]\r\nType=Application\r\nExec=/opt/gammy/bin/gammy\r\nHidden=false\r\nNoDisplay=false\r\nX-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true\r\nName=Gammy adaptive screen brightness\r\n```",
