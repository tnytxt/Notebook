1. Puss Moth

The [Puss Moth](https://butterfly-conservation.org/moths/puss-moth) caterpillar features a chunky green body, long twin tails, and a large head. When threatened, it raises its head, displaying large eyespots to appear larger, and waves its tails, which have pinkish flagellae. If that fails, it can squirt formic acid at predators!

2. Woolly Bear

The [Garden Tiger](https://butterfly-conservation.org/moths/garden-tiger) moth caterpillar, or Woolly Bear, is large and hairy, with a dense layer of ginger, black, and long white hairs. These hairs irritate potential predators and can also cause discomfort to humans, so it's best to avoid handling them.

3. Elephant Hawk-moth

The [Elephant Hawk-moth](https://butterfly-conservation.org/moths/elephant-hawk-moth) caterpillar is one of the largest in the UK, named for its trunk-like appearance. When threatened, it can retract its head and swell its body, enhancing its eye spots to resemble a snake, deterring predators. Look for them in August and September.

4. Early Thorn

The [Early Thorn](https://butterfly-conservation.org/moths/early-thorn) caterpillar is a master of disguise, camouflaged to resemble twigs of native trees like hawthorn, birch, and hazel. Its mottled browns and knobbly protrusions help it blend into its surroundings, making it easy to overlook.

5. Cinnabar

In contrast, the Cinnabar Moth caterpillars are hard to miss with their vibrant yellow and black stripes, signaling their toxicity to predators. They accumulate toxins by feeding on Ragwort, and the adult moths mimic this warning coloration with their bold black and red patterns.
