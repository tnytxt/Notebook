✏️ Common Types of Operators In Linux 
[edit tags - to fooking many]
In Linux/Unix-like operating systems, operators are often referred to as **shell operators** or **command operators**. They are used in shell scripting and command-line interfaces to perform various operations. Here are some common types of operators in the context of Linux:

1. **Arithmetic Operators**: Used for mathematical calculations in shell scripts.
   - `+` (addition)
   - `-` (subtraction)
   - `*` (multiplication)
   - `/` (division)
   - `%` (modulus)  

2. **Comparison Operators**: Used to compare values, often within conditional statements.
   - `-eq` (equal to)
   - `-ne` (not equal to)
   - `-gt` (greater than)
   - `-lt` (less than)
   - `-ge` (greater than or equal to)
   - `-le` (less than or equal to)

3. **Logical Operators**: Used to combine conditions.
   - `&&` (logical AND)
   - `||` (logical OR)
   - `!` (logical NOT)

4. **Redirection Operators**: Used to redirect input and output.
   - `>` (redirect output to a file)
   - `>>` (append output to a file)
   - `<` (redirect input from a file)
   - `2>` (redirect error output to a file)
   - `&>` (redirect both standard output and error)

5. **Pipe Operator**: Used to pass the output of one command as input to another.
   - `|` (pipe)

6. **Background Operator**: Used to run a command in the background.
   - `&` (run command in the background)

7. **Command Substitution**: Used to execute a command and substitute its output.
   - `` `command` `` or `$(command)`

These operators are essential for writing scripts and executing commands efficiently in the Linux shell environment.
