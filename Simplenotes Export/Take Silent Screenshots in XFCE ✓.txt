Take Silent Screenshots in XFCE ✓

To use shell features like variable expansion or command substitution in an XFCE keyboard shortcut (for example, to save screenshots with a timestamped filename), you need to wrap your command with **`sh -c`**. This is because XFCE shortcuts do not invoke a shell by default, so things like **`$(date ...)`** won't work unless explicitly run in a shell context.

Here’s an example command that takes a fullscreen screenshot, includes the mouse pointer, and saves it to your Pictures/Screenshots folder with a timestamped filename (including milliseconds to avoid overwriting):

```
sh -c 'xfce4-screenshooter -f -m -s "$HOME/Pictures/Screenshots/Screenshot_$(date "+%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M-%S-%3N").png"'
```
This command can be set as a keyboard shortcut in XFCE and will run silently—no dialog or popup will appear, and the screenshot will be saved automatically with the desired filename[6].

- **`sh -c`** starts a shell session to interpret the command string.
- Everything inside the single quotes is run by the shell, so **`$HOME`** and **`$(date ...)`** are expanded properly.
- The **`-f`** flag means fullscreen, **`-m`** includes the mouse pointer, and **`-s`** specifies the save path.

You can adjust the options as needed (e.g., use **`-w`** for window, **`-r`** for region, etc.)[1][4].

**Tip:** If you want to ensure absolutely no notification or popup, make sure not to use flags like **`--show`** or **`--open`**. This method is silent and script-friendly.
