Not all guitarists can read music, but guitarists will find chord diagrams easy to follow.

Chord diagrams make it easy for a guitarist to learn to play chords of a song or an instrumental - if they are adept at playing each chord in the first instance. When chords are included in a music layout for the guitar, a guitarist can learn to play the composition gradually, through breaking the composition down into sequential segments.

Complementing a music score, chord layouts will be vitally important to a guitarist who can read music. This will allow a guitarist to play both rhythm guitar and lead guitar parts by sight alone. Without a chord diagram, a guitarist who can't read music will either need to play the parts by ear, or be taught by a fellow guitarist the chords and notes of the composition. For a skilled guitarist, who only uses chord diagrams, they will be able to work out the notes of a composition via the chords.

• A Vital Aid in Learning How to Play

For beginner guitarists, chord position layouts are essential in helping a guitarist learn how to play. Even for someone who can read music, learning the chords is the first part of learning how to play the guitar. Chord layouts are particularly useful for a music teacher in teaching budding guitarists the basics of learning how to play the guitar. Once a guitarist has managed to master the basic chords, such as

`G, G7, D7, C, F, F7, A, E, Em, D`

etc, then they can progress to playing compositions, and then notes. Chord diagrams make it easy for a beginner to practice on their own also.

When guitarists want to play the same song together, [chord diagrams](http://www.guitar-chords.org.uk) simplifies and speeds up the process. When the chords have been learnt then each guitarist has the foundations of the song. This allows each guitarist to improvise around the chords much more easily.

• Easy for Guitarists to Follow

For guitarists who are songwriters, and who can't read music, the best way of writing down their composition is through chord diagrams. It's also the best way of helping other guitarists, who can't read music, to learn a composition. The chord diagram of a song is easy to create and pass around.

Anyone thinking of learning how to play the guitar will become more encouraged to do so when they are able to find a way of learning to play that isn't complicated. The beauty of chord diagrams is that they do this.
