Script: Hyphens to spaces, and title case

```bash
for file in *; do
  # Replace hyphens with spaces, then convert to title case
  new_file=$(echo "$file" | tr -s '-' ' ' | awk '{for(i=1;i<=NF;i++) $i=toupper(substr($i,1,1)) tolower(substr($i,2))}1')   
 
# Rename the file
  mv "$file" "$new_file"
done
```

**Explanation:**  

1. This cmd **`tr -s '-' ' '`**: replaces all hyphens (`-`) with spaces (`' '`)   
The `-s` option squeezes multiple consecutive hyphens into a single space (if there are multiple hyphens next to each other).
   
2. **`awk`**  
This `awk` command converts the filename to **title case** by capitalizing the first letter of each word and making the rest of the letters lowercase.

3. **`mv "$file" "$new_file"`**:  
Renames the file from its original name to the newly formatted title-cased name.

**Example:**

If you have files like:
- `my-file-name.txt`
- `hello-world-file.txt`

After running the script, they will be renamed to:
- `My File Name.txt`
- `Hello World File.txt`

**Notes:**
- **Underscores** will remain unaffected since we're only replacing hyphens with spaces.
- **Multiple hyphens**: If the filename contains multiple hyphens, they will be replaced by a single space (`-` → ` `). If you don't want this, remove the `-s` from `tr`.
