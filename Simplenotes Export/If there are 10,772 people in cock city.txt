Question: If there are 10,772 people in cock city – or 12.3% of the total cities total population. 

How do i do the calculations to find the total population of a cock city.  
  
A. It sounds like you meant:

> 10,772 people = 12.3% of the total population.

To find the **total population**, you reverse the percentage calculation:


**Step-by-step:**

1. **Write the equation**:
    10,772=12.3%×Total Population10,772 = 12.3\% \times \text{Total Population}

2. **Convert the percent to decimal**:
    12\.3%=0.12312.3\% = 0.123

3. **Divide both sides by 0.123**:
    Total Population=10,7720.123\text{Total Population} = \frac{10,772}{0.123}

4. **Do the division**:
    Total Population=87,561.788...\text{Total Population} = 87,561.788...

## **Answer**✅: about **87,562 people** total.

  
If you want, I can also show you a quick mental math shortcut for this kind of “percentage to total” problem.  
  
Alright — here’s the mental math shortcut for problems like:  
“X people is Y% of the total — find total.”

## **Shortcut Method**

If  
Part=Percent×Total\text{Part} = \text{Percent} \times \text{Total}  
then  
Total=Part×100Percent\text{Total} = \frac{\text{Part} \times 100}{\text{Percent}}

For your example:

1. Multiply **10,772 × 100**
    → 1,077,200

2. Divide by **12\.3**
    - 12 × 7,300 ≈ 87,600 (close enough!)
    - More precisely: 1,077,200 ÷ 12.3 ≈ **87,562**

💡 **Trick to speed it up**

- Round the percent to something friendly (e.g., 12 instead of 12.3) to estimate.
- Then adjust:
    - If your rounded percent was *smaller* than the actual, your estimate will be *too big* — so shrink it slightly.
    - If your rounded percent was *bigger*, bump your estimate up a bit.

If you like, I can give you a **one-line “divide by percent” memory hack** so you can do this in your head without a calculator.

## The one-liner you can keep in your head:

**💡 “Move the decimal two places right, then divide by the percent number.”**

---

For your case:

1. **Move decimal 2 places right** on 10,772 → **1,077,200**
2. **Divide by the percent number** (12.3) → 87,562

That’s it.  
It works because “×100 ÷ percent” is exactly what the formula needs.
