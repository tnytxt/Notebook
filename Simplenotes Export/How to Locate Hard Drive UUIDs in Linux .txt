How to Locate Hard Drive UUIDs in Linux ✓

To find the UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) of hard drives in Linux, you can use several methods. Here are some common approaches:

### 1. Using the `blkid` Command
The `blkid` command is a simple way to list all block devices and their UUIDs.

```bash
sudo blkid
```

This command will display output similar to the following:

```
/dev/sda1: UUID="1234-5678" TYPE="ext4" 
/dev/sdb1: UUID="8765-4321" TYPE="xfs"
```

### 2. Using the `lsblk` Command
The `lsblk` command can also show UUIDs along with other information about block devices.

```bash
lsblk -o NAME,UUID
```

This will provide a list of devices with their names and UUIDs.

### 3. Checking `/dev/disk/by-uuid/`
You can also look in the `/dev/disk/by-uuid/` directory, which contains symbolic links to devices based on their UUIDs.

```bash
ls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid/
```

This will show you the UUIDs and the corresponding device names.

### 4. Using the `fdisk` Command
While `fdisk` is primarily used for partitioning, it can also show UUIDs.

```bash
sudo fdisk -l
```

Look for the UUIDs in the output, although this method may not always display them.

### 5. Using `parted`
The `parted` command can also be used to list UUIDs.

```bash
sudo parted -l
```

This will show detailed information about all partitions, including their UUIDs.

### Summary
Any of these methods will help you find the UUIDs of your hard drives in Linux. The `blkid` command is often the most straightforward and commonly used method.
