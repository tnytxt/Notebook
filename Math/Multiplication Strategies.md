### Multiplication Strategies    

There are a number of different strategies that can help to make  
multiplication easier.

**Multiplying by 2**

When multiplying by 2, simply double the number.
**Example:**  20 x 2 = 40

**Multiplying by 4**

When multiplying by 4, double the number and then double it again.
**Example:**  6 x 4 = 24 is the same as 6 x 2 = 12 then 12 x 2 = 24

**Multiplying by 5**

When multiplying by 5, multiply the number by 10 and halve it.
**Example:**  7 x 5 = 35 is the same as 7 x 10 = 70 then half of 70 = 35

**Multiplying by 10**

When multiplying by 10, put a zero on the end of the number that is  
multiplied by 10.
**Example:** 7 x 10 = 70
