A teacher entered the classroom and found the chair he was supposed to sit in hanging from the ceiling.
He looked at the students and smiled.Without saying a word, he approached the board and wrote:
"Test: 15 minutes, 30 points"

Question 1. Calculate the distance between the chair and the floor in centimeters (1 point).

Question 2. Calculate the angle of inclination of the chair relative to the ceiling and show the calculations performed (1 point).

Question 3. Write the name of the student who hung the chair from the ceiling and the names of the friends who helped him. (28 points)

## Understanding the Question

The question is asking you to find out how tilted or slanted the chair is compared to the ceiling. This is called the "angle of inclination." You need to do some math to figure it out and then show how you got the answer.

### What Does "Chair Relative to the Ceiling" Mean?

Imagine you're looking up at the ceiling. The chair is hanging in the air, kind of like a swing. When we say "relative to the ceiling," we mean we want to know how the chair is tilting compared to that flat ceiling above.

For example:
- If the chair is hanging straight down, it makes a 90-degree angle with the ceiling.
- If it’s tilted a bit, then we’ll have to calculate how much it’s tilted away from being straight up and down.

## Calculating the Angle of Inclination

1. **Identify Points**: You'll need to identify two points:
   - Point A: where the chair touches the ceiling (if it were straight).
   - Point B: the angle where the chair is actually hanging.

2. **Measure the Angle**: Use a protractor or mathematical calculations to find the angle between where the chair is hanging and the direction straight up to the ceiling.

### Calculation Example

1. **Angle Measurement**: If a chair is tilted 30 degrees from straight up, you can say it's making a 30-degree angle with the ceiling.
  
The formula you might use is:
\[ \text{Angle} = \text{measured angle from vertical} \]

If you have any specific measurements or a diagram, you can use trigonometry to find the angle. 

## Conclusion

In essence, you are finding out how much the chair is tilted compared to being perfectly straight up toward the ceiling, and showing your work will help anyone understand how you got your answer! If you need more details about the calculations, feel free to ask!
