Note

  Your method for calculating the annual cost when the monthly cost is £30 works
because you recognize that £30 can be thought of as 3 (tens) × 10, so 3 × 12 =
36, and adding a zero gives 360, which is £360. This is a clever shortcut for
£30 × 12, as it avoids directly multiplying 30 by 12.

However, when the monthly cost is £300, your shortcut doesn’t apply as easily
because £300 is 3 (hundreds) × 100, and the same mental trick doesn’t directly
scale. Let’s break down how to calculate the annual cost for £300 per month over
12 months and find a simple way to approach it.


STEP-BY-STEP CALCULATION

 1. Understand the problem: You need to find the total cost of £300 per month
    for 12 months. This is £300 × 12.
 2. Direct multiplication:
    * £300 × 12 = £300 × (10 + 2) = (£300 × 10) + (£300 × 2) = £3,000 + £600 =
      £3,600.
    * Alternatively, think of it as 300 × 12 = 3,600, then add the pound sign:
      £3,600.
 3. Alternative method (similar to your shortcut):
    * Notice that £300 = 3 × £100.
    * First, calculate 3 × 12 = 36 (as you did for £30).
    * Since £300 is 3 hundreds, multiply 36 by 100 (instead of 10 as in your
      original method): 36 × 100 = 3,600.
    * So, the total is £3,600.


WHY YOUR SHORTCUT DOESN’T DIRECTLY WORK

Your original method relies on £30 being 3 × 10, so multiplying 3 by 12 and
adding a zero (to account for the ×10) gives the correct result. For £300, the
factor is 100 (not 10), so you need to adjust the final step by multiplying by
100 (adding two zeros) instead of 10 (adding one zero). Thus:
 * 3 × 12 = 36.
 * Then 36 × 100 = 3,600 (add two zeros for hundreds), giving £3,600.


GENERALIZING THE METHOD

For any monthly cost like £X, where X can be written as a single digit (or
simple number) times a power of 10 (e.g., £30 = 3 × 10, £300 = 3 × 100):
 1. Identify the base number (e.g., 3 for £30 or £300).
 2. Multiply the base number by 12 (e.g., 3 × 12 = 36).
 3. Multiply by the appropriate power of 10 (e.g., 10 for £30, 100 for £300).
    * For £30: 36 × 10 = 360 → £360.
    * For £300: 36 × 100 = 3,600 → £3,600.


ANSWER

The total cost for £300 per month for 12 months is £3,600. You can use a
modified version of your shortcut: calculate 3 × 12 = 36, then multiply by 100
(since £300 is 3 hundreds), giving 36 × 100 = 3,600, or £3,600.
