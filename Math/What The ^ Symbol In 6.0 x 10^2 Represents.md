### 1.How heavy is Planet Earth?

I Prompted Gemini AI about any ideas of how much planet earth could weigh. the reply was: **earth weighs approximately 6.0 x 10^24 kilograms.** This is a massive number that's hard to comprehend!. I asked Gemini to put it into a word... the reply was, **Earth weighs approximately six sextillion kilograms.**

So how heavy is sextillion kilograms? well, you may have an idea of how big a trillion is... a lot! so how many trillions are in a sextillion?, There are one million trillions in in a sextillion, and we have six of them, so there are one million trillions in a sextillion.

I also asked how big a shed i would need to store 6 sextillion in dollars. Gemini laughed and said...

> A shed would not be big enough to store one sextillion dollars.** Even if you could fit one-dollar bills into the shed, the sheer number of bills would be astronomical. A sextillion is a million billion billion, which is a number so large that it's difficult to comprehend.
> 
> If you could stack the bills on top of each other, the stack would be so tall it would reach far beyond the moon.
> 
> Therefore, there is no practical way to store one sextillion dollars in a shed or any other physical container.

I asked about using an aircraft hanger to store 6 sextillion, but it gave the same reply above. I was thinking, well it doesn't have to be one just one aircraft hanger, it could be hundreds.
The idea of thousands of aircraft hanger size buildings not being able to hold 6 sextillion dollars between them is bonkers. 

Moving on from finding out how to stuff sextillion of dollars into every shed in the universe, I then asked how many times could just one  sextillion dollars could circle the earth

> It's difficult to calculate exactly how many times one sextillion dollars could circle the Earth.** This is because the calculation would depend on several factors, such as:
> 
> -   **The size of the bills:** Different denominations of currency have different sizes.
> -   **The thickness of the bills:** The number of bills that could fit into a certain space would depend on their thickness.
> -   **The spacing between the bills:** If the bills were stacked with no space between them, more could fit into a given area.
> 
> However, we can make a rough estimate. Let's assume we're using one-dollar bills and stacking them without any space between them.
> 
> -   The thickness of a one-dollar bill is approximately 0.0043 inches.
> -   The circumference of the Earth is approximately 24,901 miles, or 1,317,385,600 inches.
> 
> Dividing the circumference of the Earth by the thickness of a one-dollar bill, we get:
> 
> **1,317,385,600 inches / 0.0043 inches/bill ≈ 306,578,000 bills**
> 
> So, if we could stack one-dollar bills end-to-end without any gaps, it would take approximately 306,578,000 bills to circle the Earth once.
> 
> Now, we need to determine how many times we could circle the Earth with one sextillion dollars.
> A sextillion is 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000. Dividing a sextillion by 306,578,000, we get:
> 
> **1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 / 306,578,000 ≈ 3,259,252,928,000**
> 
> So, one sextillion dollars could circle the Earth approximately **3,259,252,928,000 times** if stacked end-to-end without any gaps. This is a massive number that highlights the sheer scale of a sextillion.

### 2.What does the ^ symbol mean
```
This symbol `^` in  6.0 x 10^2 represents rexponentiation.
```

It means that 10 is raised to the power of 24. In other words, 10 is multiplied by itself 24 times. So, 10^24 is equal to 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 x 10.

This **notation** is used to represent very large or very small numbers in a compact way.  

**Is 6.0 x 10^24 an equation?.**

**No**. An equation is a mathematical statement that shows that two expressions are equal. It contains an equals sign (=). For example, 2x + 3 = 7 is an equation.

6.0 x 10^24 is simply a number written in scientific notation. It represents the value six sextillion.

**A septillion** is a number larger than a sextillion.

Here's a breakdown of these large numbers:

-   **Trillion:** 1,000,000,000,000
-   **Quadrillion:** 1,000,000,000,000,000
-   **Quintillion:** 1,000,000,000,000,000,000
-   **Sextillion:** 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000
-   **Septillion:** 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000
