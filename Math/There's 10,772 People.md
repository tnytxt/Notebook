Q: If 10,772 People equals 12.3% of Population of Big Titty City, What's The
Total Population

To find the total population, you reverse the percentage calculation:
### Step-by-step
1. Write the equation:  
   10,772 = 12.3% × Total Population

2. Convert the percent to decimal:  
   12.3% = 0.123

3. Solve for Total Population (divide both sides by 0.123):  
   Total Population = 10,772 / 0.123

4. Do the division:  
   Total Population ≈ 87,561.788...

Rounded reasonably: Total Population ≈ **87,562**.

If you want, I can also show you a quick mental math shortcut for this kind of
“percentage to total” problem.

Alright — here’s the mental math shortcut for problems like:
“X people is Y% of the total — find total.”

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SHORTCUT METHOD

If Part=Percent×Total\text{Part} = \text{Percent} \times \text{Total}
then
Total=Part×100Percent\text{Total} = \frac{\text{Part} \times
100}{\text{Percent}}

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For your example:
 1. Multiply 10,772 × 100→ 1,077,200
 2. Divide by 12.3
    * 12 × 7,300 ≈ 87,600 (close enough!)
    * More precisely: 1,077,200 ÷ 12.3 ≈ 87,562

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

💡 Trick to speed it up
 * Round the percent to something friendly (e.g., 12 instead of 12.3) to
   estimate.
 * Then adjust:
   * If your rounded percent was smaller than the actual, your estimate will be
     too big — so shrink it slightly.
   * If your rounded percent was bigger, bump your estimate up a bit.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you like, I can give you a one-line “divide by percent” memory hack so you
can do this in your head without a calculator.


THE ONE-LINER YOU CAN KEEP IN YOUR HEAD:

💡 “Move the decimal two places right, then divide by the percent number.”

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For your case:
 1. Move decimal 2 places right on 10,772 → 1,077,200
 2. Divide by the percent number (12.3) → 87,562

That’s it.
It works because “×100 ÷ percent” is exactly what the formula needs.

eyeball answers even faster without fully dividing.
