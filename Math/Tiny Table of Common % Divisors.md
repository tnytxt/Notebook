Tiny table of common % divisors

  Here’s a small mental math %-to-divider table so you can go from “part” to
“total” in your head even faster.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FORMULA REMINDER:


Total=Part×100Percent\text{Total} = \frac{\text{Part} \times
100}{\text{Percent}}

So: multiply by the number in the right column.

TABLE

PERCENT   MULTIPLY BY…
1%        100
2%        50
5%        20
10%       10
12.5%     8
20%       5
25%       4
33⅓%      3
50%       2
75%       1.333…

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


For 12.3%, you’d know 12.5% = ×8, so mentally start there and tweak slightly
upward because 12.3% is a little less, meaning the total will be slightly more
than the ×8 result.
If you want, I can also make you a quick mental % wheel diagram you can keep for
instant recall.
