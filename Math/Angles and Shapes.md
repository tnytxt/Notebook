**Angles**

A right angle is 90º also known as a quarter turn. There are four quarters in 360º. A right angle can be anywhere in a shape, I always thought it had to be on the right hand side 😕 Many shapes and objects can have right angles and some do not, like a Pentagon, a circle, a triangle.

**Symmetry**

A 2D shape is symmetrical if a line can be drawn through it and either side is a reflection of the other. The line is called a line of symmetry. This is sometimes called a 'mirror line' or 'mirror symmetry', because if you put a mirror on the line, the reflection would show the whole shape.

- An isosceles triangle has 1 line of symmetry
- An equilateral triangle has 3 lines of symmetry
- An scalene triangle does not have line of symmetry
- A square has 4 lines of symmetry
- A circle has unlimited lines of symmetry!

**Shapes can be 2D or 3D**

The name of the shape can change depending on whether it is 2D or 3D.

- A square is 2D but its 3D form is called a “cube”
- A circle is 2D but its 3D form is called a “sphere”
- A rectangle is 2D but its 3D form is called a “cuboid”
- A Triangle is 2D but its 3D form is called a “pyramid”
