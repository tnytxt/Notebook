> If a team has 20 players and 12 are girls, what is the % of girls in the team

To find the percentage of girls in the team, follow these steps:

1.  **Divide the number of girls by the total number of players:** 12 girls / 20 players = 0.6.
2.  **Convert the decimal to a percentage:** 0.6 is equivalent to 60% (0.6 multiplied by 100).

Therefore, 60% of the team members are girls.
