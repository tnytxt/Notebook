A job vacancy pays £12.21ph or 24,000 a year. "How many hours per week would you
need to work at a rate of £12.21ph to earn an annual salary of £24,000?"
 1. To find out how many hours you worked in a year, you need to divide your
    yearly salary by your hourly wage. Think of it like this: you want to know
    how many "£12.21" fit into your £24,000.
 2. Here's the math:

 * Take your salary: £24,000
 * Divide it by your hourly wage: £12.21

So, you do this calculation:

24000 / 12.21
 3. When you do that division, you get about 1961.57.
 4. What this means is that you worked roughly 1,962 hours in the year.
