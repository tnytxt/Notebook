**The word you're looking for is "learning style."**

People have different learning styles, which influence how they absorb and retain information. For example, some people learn best visually (by seeing), others learn best auditorily (by hearing), and still others learn best [kinesthetically](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=examples+of+kinesthetic+learning+style&t=vivaldi&ia=web) (by doing).

In your example, someone who is good at English but not good at math might have a learning style that favors verbal and linguistic skills, but struggles with logical and mathematical reasoning.

> what can a person do to help them with logical and mathematical reasoning.
