### Are worksheets really worth it?

***Why am I asking this question?***

Because it bothered me while researching for this article.

Teachers have a mixed review if worksheets are good or bad for students.

High School teacher and author of [Experiential Learning Depot](https://www.experientiallearningdepot.com/experiential-learning-blog/why-i-dont-give-my-students-worksheets-and-what-i-do-instead), Sara Segar, is strictly No-No for giving worksheets to students.

On the other hand, **some educators have mixed opinions if worksheets should be used in the classroom**.

> I personally believe that worksheets are excellent teacher resources if made thoughtfully by keeping the students and **learning outcome** in mind. Worksheets must be used in **moderation** onlyto **practice a concept**, not to teach it.

Jane, a trained primary teacher from Australia, writes about **[good, bad, and ugly worksheets](http://foundationintofirst.blogspot.com/2017/08/should-you-use-worksheets-in-your.html)** in her blog.

This raises the next question-

### Are worksheets beneficial in learning Mathematics?

![A boy enjoying practicing a Maths worksheet.](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*8W3GtnVrpJgMJYRcv2ObQg.png)

Worksheets are beneficial in [learning Mathematics](https://medium.com/@manikapant18/thought-you-have-overcome-the-monster-under-your-bed-1c772b43ad7) because they [enhance student achievement](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1066356.pdf), improve focus, and [promote self-learning and practice](https://www.maa.org/programs/faculty-and-departments/curriculum-department-guidelines-recommendations/innovative-teaching-exchange/in-class-worksheets).

Math requires drill and practice. Math worksheets are highly beneficial in practicing — *not teaching* — Addition, Subtraction, Division, and Multiplication. It is best to use Math worksheets for grades 1 to 5, as most of the fundamental mathematical concepts are taught in primary classes.

Now that you know the benefits of Math worksheets, read these **tips on how to create the best Math worksheets.**

### How to make Math worksheets effective?

![Design effective Math worksheets online.](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*SIprLJT4AMKHRcBk3HIMGA.png)

#### 1\. Create for students

Sounds obvious, right? But teachers get carried away making worksheets. Because every teacher wants to create the best worksheets, the purpose of creating them is lost.

**For instance-**

If you want to make a Class 1 Math worksheet on Addition, keep questions that first build the concept of "putting things together in addition" and then take the students to practice addition sums.

Move from **easy to difficult questions** so students don't get demotivated by the wrong answers in the beginning.

And **never give worksheets for homework**, unless necessary. It's important that you check the method of solving the addition problem instead of only the final answer.

**In short** -

Create worksheets keeping in mind the intellectual level and needs of students.

Some students like pictures.

Some like to go slow.

Some like to do it as a group activity.

Remember the **Theory of Multiple Intelligences**?

![Multiple intelligences to consider while making online Math worksheets.](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*WMHfKtzUPhq-asyri-iVvA.jpeg)

Theory of Multiple Intelligences: Source [Wikipedia.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_multiple_intelligences)

Create your Math worksheets based on this theory, according to students' different intelligence needs.

It improves their Math achievement, as per this [study published in the Universal Journal of Educational Research](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1150931.pdf).

#### 2\. Add value to learning experience

You mostly use worksheets to keep students busy.

Holidays? Assign worksheets.

Free period? Give worksheet.

Activity time? Worksheets will keep them busy.

Jennifer Gonzalez, the creator of [Cult of Pedagogy](https://www.cultofpedagogy.com/), has [differentiated 'Busysheets' from 'Powersheets](https://www.cultofpedagogy.com/busysheets/) '.

**▶ Busysheets** are worksheets that are only meant to keep students occupied. Like sums, crossword puzzles, coloring, and pasting work.

They add no educational value.

**▶ Powersheets,** on the other hand, involve all senses of the students. These add immense educational value to their learning experience.

Like a data handling task, in which a student collects data, organizes it, analyzes it, and then finds a conclusion.

This takes us to the next point.

#### 3\. Based on Bloom's Taxonomy

There was a reason Bloom gave that taxonomy: Taught in every teacher-training course.

#### Meaningful worksheets focus not only on 'knowing' and 'understanding' a concept but also on 'applying', 'analyzing', and sometimes 'creating' new knowledge.

**For example**

Consider Elementary Shapes.

If you want to create a Class 3 Maths worksheet on this topic, start with a question on the properties of shapes.

**→ Which elementary shape has three sides?**

Next, put questions on **understanding** and **analyzing** elementary shapes.

**→ Colour the squares blue and rectangles green (from a given set of shapes).**

Don't stop here.

Add questions on **creating** and **evaluating**.

**→ Draw a rectangle having all sides equal.**

**→ Why all squares are rectangles but not all rectangles are squares?**

Do these questions boggle your mind?

Then they'll excite your students also.

#### 4\. Keep Math worksheets short, simple, and fun.

Make short worksheets. Students don't enjoy long mindless writing work.

✔️ They should have fun solving Math problems.

✔️Ask straightforward questions in the worksheet.

✔️Use legible font.

✔️Give adequate space for notes and calculation work.

✔️Write clear questions and instructions.

Some students don't share their school activities with their parents.

I used to get a lot of complaints in the Parents-Teacher meeting.

" *My child doesn't tell me what he learned at school."*

Well, just share your class Maths worksheets with the parents through this link!

### Over To You

Worksheets have been an integral part of the teaching-learning process. Mathematics concepts can be practiced and strengthened using worksheets.

However, they're only beneficial for the students if they add educational value.

There's a thin line between good effective worksheets and bad paper sheets full of copy-pasting, tedious questions whose sole purpose is to keep students busy. You'll know the difference by just having a look at them. If they bore you, they won't be [fun for your students](https://medium.com/@manikapant18/what-is-immersive-reading-and-how-it-makes-reading-fun-c71308ee1a04) as well.

> The best Maths worksheets are those that students look forward to — with questions involving critical thinking, analyzing, evaluating, and creating knowledge.
