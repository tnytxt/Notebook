### Subtraction Strategies

**Counting Up**  
This method of subtracting is like 'counting on'.  
Start with the smallest number and count up to the higher number.

**Example:**
8 -- 5 = ?
The smallest number is 5 so count up 6, 7, 8.  
How many numbers did you count?

6, 7 and 8 = 3 numbers. So the answer is 3.

**Example:**
9 -- 4 = ?
The smallest number is 4 so count up 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.  
How many numbers did you count?

5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 = 5 numbers. So the answer is 5.

**Subtraction with Exchanging**

**Splitting Numbers.**  
Numbers can be split into tens and units to make subtraction easier.  
Split the number you are subtracting into tens and units.  
Subtract the tens and then subtract the units.

**Example:**
26 - 14 = 26 - 10 - 4
\= 16 - 4
\= 12
