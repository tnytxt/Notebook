Q. "30% share of a home costs £88,500, what’s the total market value"?

  "If a 30% share of an apartment costs £88,500, what is the total market value of
the apartment?"

THE QUICK WAY:

 1. Convert the share to a decimal -- 30% → 0.30
 2. Divide the price you’re given by that decimal -- £88,500 ÷ 0.30 = £295,000

So the full market value of the apartment is £295,000.

EXPLAIN IT LIKE I'M A CHILD:

Step 1 — understand the question:
 * 30% of the whole apartment costs £88,500. That means £88,500 is just part of
   the full price.

Step 2 — find what 1% costs:
 * If 30% = £88,500, then 1% = £88,500 ÷ 30 = £2,950.

Step 3 — find 100% (the whole apartment):
 * 100% = 1% × 100 = £2,950 × 100 = £295,000.

Answer: The total market value of the apartment is £295,000.

Simple child-friendly analogy:
Imagine the apartment is a chocolate bar cut into 100 equal squares. Someone
buys 30 squares and pays £88,500. Each small square is £88,500 ÷ 30 = £2,950. If
you put all 100 squares back together, the whole chocolate bar costs 100 ×
£2,950 = £295,000.

WHY THIS WORKS (AND A REUSABLE FORMULA)

If a share price represents p% of the home, then
Total value = Share price ÷ (p ÷ 100)

Example check: 30% of £295,000 = 0.30 × 295,000 = £88,500 ✅

IF YOU MEANT “ACTUAL TOTAL COST TO LIVE THERE”

With UK shared ownership, monthly costs usually include:
 * Mortgage payments on the £88,500 you buy
 * Rent on the remaining 70% (often ~2–3% per year of the unsold equity, divided
   by 12)
 * Service charge/ground rent
 * Insurance and maintenance

Give me the rent percentage, mortgage rate, and term if you want a monthly cost
estimate.
