## Understanding "remission isn't arbitrary"  

The sentence is making a precise point about medical and assessment processes, likely in the context of benefits claims (such as Universal Credit, PIP, or similar) where decision-makers review ongoing or lifelong conditions.

Here’s a clear breakdown:

- The speaker is responding to someone who mentioned an **“end date”** for conditions that are normally considered ongoing or lifelong (e.g., certain mental health conditions, chronic illnesses).

- The speaker says that talking about an “end date” in those cases can only really mean one thing: **remission** – the medical term for when a disease or condition goes into a period where symptoms are significantly reduced or absent.

- Then comes the key phrase: **“remission isn't arbitrary”**.

This means:  
Declaring that a condition is in remission is **not a random, casual, or subjective decision**. It cannot be decided lightly or without solid evidence. Instead, **“it is the conclusion from a clinical investigation”** – meaning it must be based on proper medical evidence, such as examinations, test results, consultant reports, or other objective clinical findings.

In simpler terms:  
You can’t just say “this lifelong condition might end by a certain date” unless there is actual clinical proof that the person has reached remission. Remission has to be **evidenced**, not assumed or guessed.

This argument is often used in benefits discussions to push back against assessors or decision-makers who suggest a condition might improve or have an “end date” without concrete medical evidence to support that view.

If this sentence came from a specific context (e.g., a benefits forum, decision letter, or advice site), feel free to share more and I can refine the explanation further.
