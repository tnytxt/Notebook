# A.I Prompts

## My Question:
> obsidian web clipper. Show me an example of what this option in the clipper {{author|split:", "|wikilink|join}} would do

## A.I Prompt
"Show a concise example of what this Obsidian Web Clipper template does: {{author|split:', '|wikilink|join}}.

    Assume the raw author string is: 'John Doe, Jane Smith, Foo Bar'.
    Show the intermediate steps for each filter and the exact final output(s).
    If the join behavior can vary, list the two most likely final outputs (space-joined and ', '-joined)."

This gives the clipper template, a concrete input, requests step-by-step transformations, and asks for the common possible final outputs.
