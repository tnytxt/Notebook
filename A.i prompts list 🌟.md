# A.I Prompts

## My Question:
> obsidian web clipper. Show me an example of what this option in the clipper {{author|split:", "|wikilink|join}} would do

## A.I Prompt
"Show a concise example of what this Obsidian Web Clipper template does: {{author|split:', '|wikilink|join}}.

    Assume the raw author string is: 'John Doe, Jane Smith, Foo Bar'.
    Show the intermediate steps for each filter and the exact final output(s).
    If the join behavior can vary, list the two most likely final outputs (space-joined and ', '-joined)."

This gives the clipper template, a concrete input, requests step-by-step transformations, and asks for the common possible final outputs.

“Update and refine this Debian 12 installation tutorial to Debian 13 for Namecheap VPN. Improve clarity and conciseness of all text while preserving technical accuracy. Reduce all embedded image dimensions by 50%, compress them for web performance, and invert predominantly white images so they display as dark-on-light instead of light-on-dark. Keep headings, step order, and code blocks intact, and ensure the final tutorial reads as a clean, production-ready guide.”
