Written in the 2nd century AD by a little boy named Apion from a small Egyptian town. He enlisted in the Roman army in Alexandria, boarded a large government ship and sailed for Italy. The ship weathered a terrible storm. As soon as he landed, received his new uniform and paid for it, he went to be painted in a picture for his family and sent it home along with this letter:

Apion to his father and lord Epimachos: Happy birthday! First of all I hope that you are well and that things are going well for you, my sister, her daughter and my brother. I thank Lord Serapis [an Egyptian god] for saving me right away when I was in danger at sea. When I arrived in Miseno [the Roman port of war, near Naples], I received three gold coins from the emperor [Trajan?] As money for the journey, and I am fine. Please write me a line, my lord father, on your well-being, second on that of my brother and sister, and third so that I may piously greet your hand, for you have brought me well and I can therefore hope for a quick promotion, the gods willing. Give my regards to Capiton [a friend] and my brother and my sister and Serenilla [a family slave?] And my friends. I am sending you my little portrait via Euktemon. My [new] Roman name is Antonius Maximus. All my best! The letter was written in Greek on papyrus, not by the boy himself, but by a hired public letter writer. Two of Apion's friends who enlisted with him added their greetings in the left margin. The letter was originally folded and sealed. She passed through the highly efficient Roman military post and arrived healthy as far as the small village in Egypt, where the boy's father and family read it almost two thousand years ago. After the death of his father, the letter was lost in the household waste and archaeologists found it not long ago under the collapsed walls of the house. With it was another letter written by Apion years later to his sister after he had long been stationed somewhere on the Roman frontier and had a wife and children. That's all we know. If you allow, I would like to make some considerations. I admit I was moved to note this boy's pride in joining the Roman army. I find admirable the affection and gratitude for what his father had done for him, which is now rare. Generous the per diem for the transfer, of 3 aurei, corresponding to 300 sesterces, that is to say about a year's wages. Surprising that in addition to the letter he sent a portrait, I think in uniform, very modern! The Cursus Publicus is amazing, enough to deliver the letter in a small Egyptian village. Today we talk a lot about inclusion: we should learn from our ancestors. Let us remember that at the time the provincials were "Peregrini", that is, not Roman citizens.
