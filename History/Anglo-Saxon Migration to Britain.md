The letters "CE" stand for "Common Era." It is a secular term used to denote the same time period as "AD" (Anno Domini), which means "in the year of our Lord" in Latin.

- **CE (Common Era)**: Refers to the years starting from year 1 onward, similar to AD.
- **BCE (Before Common Era)**: Refers to the years before year 1, similar to BC (Before Christ).

The use of CE and BCE is intended to provide a non-religious alternative to the traditional AD and BC designations, making it more inclusive for people of different cultural and religious backgrounds.
