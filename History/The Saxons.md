The saxons

  The Saxons were one of the three main Germanic tribes that migrated to Britain
during the early medieval period, alongside the Angles and the Jutes. Here are
some key points about the Saxons:
 1. Origin: The Saxons are believed to have originated from what is now northern
    Germany, particularly the region along the Elbe River. They were part of a
    larger group of Germanic peoples.
 2. Migration to Britain: The Saxons began migrating to Britain in the 5th
    century AD, during the period of the Anglo-Saxon settlement. They settled
    primarily in the southern and southwestern parts of England, including areas
    that are now known as Sussex, Wessex, and Essex.
 3. Historical Accounts: Much of what is known about the Saxons comes from
    historical sources, particularly the writings of the Venerable Bede, an
    8th-century monk and historian. In his work "Ecclesiastical History of the
    English People," Bede describes the arrival of the Saxons and their
    settlements.
 4. Culture and Society: The Saxons had a warrior-based society and practised
    agriculture. They brought their own customs, language, and social structures
    to Britain, which contributed to the development of early English culture.
    The Old English language, which evolved from the dialects spoken by the
    Saxons, Angles, and Jutes, is the precursor to modern English.
 5. Legacy: The Saxons played a significant role in the formation of early
    medieval England. They established several kingdoms, including Wessex,
    Sussex, and Essex, which became important political entities. The Saxon
    period saw the development of local governance, law, and culture that would
    influence later English history.
 6. Christianisation: The Saxons were gradually converted to Christianity,
    particularly during the 7th century, which had a profound impact on their
    culture and society. Missionaries, such as St. Augustine of Canterbury,
    played a key role in this process.

Overall, the Saxons were a crucial part of the early history of England,
contributing to the cultural, social, and political landscape of the time. Their
legacy is still evident in place names, language, and historical records
throughout England.
