A groundbreaking discovery in a Spanish cave suggests that Neanderthals may have been capable of abstract thought long before their interactions with modern humans.

Researchers have found 15 small marine fossils in the Prado Vargas Cave in Burgos, Spain, dating back 39,800 to 54,600 years. These fossils, which appear to hold no practical value, were likely collected deliberately by Neanderthals, providing intriguing evidence of their cognitive abilities.

## **Neanderthal Fossil Collection Hints at Abstract Thinking and Symbolism**

The fossils, mostly mollusks and echinoderms, were analyzed by researchers from the University of Burgos and the University of Málaga, [ScienceAlert](https://www.sciencealert.com/mysterious-fossils-suggest-neanderthals-were-capable-of-abstract-thought) said.

Only one fossil showed signs of being used as a tool, while the rest appeared unaltered.

The researchers believe these items were gathered for reasons beyond necessity, such as curiosity, ornamentation, or social symbolism. This behavior hints at abstract thinking — the ability to imagine concepts beyond immediate experiences — an important hallmark of human cognition.

The fossils' origins are as fascinating as their presence in the cave. Some were transported from locations over 30 kilometers away, suggesting deliberate collection and transport.

This effort implies a meaningful purpose behind their gathering, whether it was aesthetic appreciation, symbolic use, or even as part of group identity.

Researchers also speculate that Neanderthal children might have played a role, as similar collecting behaviors are common among young modern humans.

## **Prado Vargas Fossils Reveal Neanderthals' Independent Abstract Thinking**

The Prado Vargas discovery is significant because it predates evidence of modern human activity in the region. This suggests that Neanderthals independently developed behaviors associated with abstract thought, rather than adopting them from Homo sapiens.

Previous studies have already hinted at their cognitive complexity, noting their use of feathers, claws, and shells for decoration and their burial practices.

According to [ArcheologyNews](https://archaeologymag.com/2024/11/neanderthals-were-the-first-fossil-collectors/), the collection from Prado Vargas stands out not only for its size — 15 fossils compared to the typical one or two items found at other Neanderthal sites — but also for what it reveals about their mindset.

These fossils likely carried a deeper meaning, representing more than simple objects. They could signify an early form of artistic appreciation or cultural identity.

This discovery challenges long-standing stereotypes about Neanderthals as simple-minded or inferior to modern humans. Instead, it adds to a growing body of evidence that they were capable of sophisticated, symbolic, and social behaviors.

As scientists continue to uncover these details, it becomes increasingly clear that our ancient cousins shared far more with us than previously thought.
