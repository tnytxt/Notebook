- *Annals* and *Histories*: Detailed accounts of the Roman Empire from the death of Augustus (AD 14) to the death of Domitian (AD 96), focusing on emperors like Tiberius, Claudius, and Nero. [^1][^2]
- *Germania*: An ethnographic study of the Germanic tribes, contrasting their virtues and vices with those of Rome.[^2][^5]
- *Agricola*: A biography of his father-in-law, highlighting the Roman conquest of Britain. [^1][^2]
- *Dialogus de oratoribus*: A dialogue on oratory and its decline in his era. [^1][^2]

Tacitus is known for his concise, incisive Latin style and his critical analysis of power, corruption, and the psychology of rulers and senators. His works are valued for their insight into Roman society, politics, and early references to Christians and Jews. [^1][^2][^5]
