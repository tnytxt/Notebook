#### Overview

The **Catuvellauni** were a powerful Celtic tribe in southeastern Britain before and during the early stages of the Roman conquest. Their name, derived from ancient Celtic roots, is often interpreted as "war-chiefs" or "excelling in battle" [^1] [^3] [^7].
#### Territory and Capital

- The Catuvellauni occupied a broad region north of the River Thames, covering modern-day Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire, and parts of Cambridgeshire, Oxfordshire, Northamptonshire, Essex, and Greater London [^1] [^3] [^6].
- Their original capital was likely at Wheathampstead, but they later established Verulamium (modern St Albans) as their main centre [^1] [^5] [^7].
#### Origins and Expansion

- The Catuvellauni are associated with the Aylesford-Swarling archaeological group, often linked to Belgic Gaul, suggesting they may have been part of a later wave of Celtic (possibly Belgic) settlers in Britain [^1] [^3] [^5].
- They expanded their territory aggressively, often at the expense of neighbouring tribes such as the Trinovantes, Dobunni, and Atrebates [^1] [^4] [^5].
- At their height, they were likely the most dominant tribe in southern Britain, exerting influence over a vast area and several subordinate tribes [^2] [^3] [^6].
#### Notable Leaders

- **Cassivellaunus**: Led British resistance against Julius Caesar's second invasion (54 BC). While his exact tribal affiliation is not named by Caesar, his territory matches that of the later Catuvellauni. He is considered the founder or unifier of the tribe [^1] [^6].
- **Tasciovanus**: Grandson of Cassivellaunus, ruled from around 20 BC. He was the first to mint coins at Verulamium and briefly controlled Camulodunum (Colchester), the Trinovantes' capital [^1] [^6] [^7].
- **Cunobelinus**: Succeeded Tasciovanus, ruled from AD 10–41, and is often identified with Shakespeare's Cymbeline. Under his rule, the Catuvellauni reached their greatest power [^1] [^5].
- **Togodumnus and Caratacus**: Sons of Cunobelinus who led resistance against the Roman invasion in AD 43. Togodumnus died early in the campaign; Caratacus continued to resist Roman rule for years [^1] [^5].
### Role in the Roman Conquest

- The Catuvellauni were central to the opposition against the Roman invasion led by Emperor Claudius in AD 43. Their defeat was crucial for Rome to secure control over southeastern Britain [^1] [^5].
- After their defeat, their territory became the nucleus of the new Roman province, with Verulamium becoming a significant Roman town [^1].
### Legacy

- The Catuvellauni are attested in Roman sources and inscriptions up to the 4th century, indicating their continued presence and adaptation under Roman rule [^1].
- Their leaders, especially Cassivellaunus and Caratacus, are remembered for their resistance to Rome and feature prominently in British legend and history [^1] [^5].
