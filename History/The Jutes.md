The jutes

  The Jutes were one of the three main Germanic tribes that migrated to Britain
during the early medieval period, alongside the Angles and Saxons. They are
believed to have originated from the Jutland Peninsula, which is part of
modern-day Denmark. Here are some key points about the Jutes:
 1. Migration to Britain: The Jutes began migrating to Britain in the 5th
    century AD, during the period of the Anglo-Saxon settlement. They are
    thought to have settled primarily in the southeastern part of England,
    particularly in areas that are now Kent, the Isle of Wight, and parts of
    Hampshire.
 2. Historical Accounts: Much of what is known about the Jutes comes from
    historical sources such as the writings of the Venerable Bede, an
    8th-century monk and historian. In his work "Ecclesiastical History of the
    English People," Bede mentions the Jutes and their settlements.
 3. Culture and Society: Like other Germanic tribes, the Jutes had a
    warrior-based society and practised agriculture. They brought their own
    customs, language, and social structures to Britain, which contributed to
    the development of early English culture.
 4. Legacy: The Jutes, along with the Angles and Saxons, played a significant
    role in the formation of early medieval England. Their influence can still
    be seen in place names and historical records from the regions they settled.

Overall, the Jutes were an important part of the early history of England,
contributing to the cultural and social landscape of the time.
