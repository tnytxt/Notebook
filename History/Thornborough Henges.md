> The northern henge is now open: We are delighted to have secured the northern henge on behalf of the nation, ensuring that visitors can now enjoy all three Thornborough henges and that their stories and significance can be shared with everyone.

This unique and important cluster of Neolithic monuments lies on a raised plateau above the river Ure. Three huge circular henges – sometimes described as the ‘Stonehenge of the North’ – were built here about 4,500 years ago over an earlier monument.

They remained important into the early Bronze Age, when burial mounds were constructed nearby. Like other henges across Britain, the Thornborough henges are each surrounded by an earthen bank. The banks at Thornborough originally stood up to 4 metres high and were broken by two opposing entrances.

People have gathered, many travelling some distance, at the henges for ceremonies and funeral rituals for at least 2,000 years. The earthworks are thought to have been part of a ‘ritual landscape’ and form part of the most important concentration of Neolithic monuments in the North of England.
