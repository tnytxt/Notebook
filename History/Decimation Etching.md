In [the military](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_of_ancient_Rome) of [ancient Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome), **decimation** (from [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_language) _decimatio_ 'removal of a tenth'\[1\]) was a form of [military discipline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_discipline) in which every tenth man in a group was executed by members of his cohort. The discipline was used by senior commanders in the [Roman army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_army) to punish units or large groups guilty of [capital offences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_offence), such as [cowardice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowardice)[, mutiny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutiny), [desertion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desertion), and [insubordination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insubordination), and for pacification of rebellious [legions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_legion). The procedure was an attempt to balance the need to punish serious offences with the realities of managing a large group of offenders.\[2\]

A [cohort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_\(military_unit\)) (roughly 480 soldiers) selected for punishment by decimation was divided into groups of ten. Each group [drew lots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drawing_lots_\(decision_making\)) ([sortition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sortition)), and the soldier on whom the lot of the shortest straw fell was executed by his nine comrades, often by [stoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoning), [clubbing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blunt_trauma), or [stabbing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stabbing). The remaining soldiers were often given rations of barley instead of wheat (the latter being the standard soldier's diet) for a few days, and required to [bivouac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bivouac_shelter) outside the fortified security of the camp for some time.\[3\]

As the punishment fell by lot, all soldiers in a group sentenced to decimation were potentially liable for execution, regardless of individual degrees of fault, rank, or distinction.

The earliest\[[_citation needed_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)\] documented decimation occurred in 471 BC during the [Roman Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Republic)'s early wars against the [Volsci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volsci) and was recorded by [Livy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livy). In an incident where his army had been scattered, consul [Appius Claudius Sabinus Regillensis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appius_Claudius_Sabinus_Regillensis_\(consul_471_BC\)) had the culprits punished for desertion: [centurions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centurion), [standard-bearers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard-bearer) and soldiers who had cast away their weapons were individually [scourged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scourged) and beheaded, while of the remainder, one in ten was chosen by lot and executed.\[4\]
