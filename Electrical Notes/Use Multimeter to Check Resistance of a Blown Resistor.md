### Use Multimeter to Check Resistance of a Blown Resistor

**How to Use a Multimeter:**

1.  **Set the Multimeter to Resistance Mode:**
    
    -   Select the ohm (Ω) symbol on the dial.
    -   Ensure the probes are firmly plugged into the correct jacks (usually labelled "COM" and "Ω").
2.  **Connect the Probes to the Resistor:**
    
    -   Touch the tips of the probes to the two leads of the resistor.
    -   Ensure a good connection to avoid inaccurate readings.
3.  **Read the Resistance Value:**
    
    -   The multimeter's display will show the resistance value in ohms.

**Identifying Infinite Resistance:**

-   **No Display:** If the multimeter's display remains blank or shows "OL" (overload), it indicates infinite resistance. This means the resistor is open and not conducting electricity.
-   **Erratic Readings:** In some cases, the multimeter might display fluctuating or inconsistent readings. This can also be a sign of an open resistor.

**Tips for Accurate Measurements:**

-   **Avoid Touching the Probe Tips:** Your body resistance can interfere with the measurement.
-   **Clean the Probe Tips:** Dirty or oxidized probe tips can lead to inaccurate readings.
-   **Check the Multimeter's Battery:** A weak battery can affect the accuracy of the readings.
-   **Consider the Resistor's Power Rating:** If the resistor is rated for high power, it might have a higher resistance when hot.

**Additional Considerations:**

-   **Surface Mount Resistors:** For surface-mount resistors, you might need special probes or a magnifying glass to make accurate connections.
-   **Component Identification:** Before replacing a resistor, ensure you correctly identify its value and power rating. Use a resistor color code chart or a multimeter with a resistance identification function.

By following these steps and understanding the signs of infinite resistance, you can effectively use a multimeter to diagnose and replace blown resistors.
