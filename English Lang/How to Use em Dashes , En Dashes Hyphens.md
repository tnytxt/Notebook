NOTES:

❔Is this to do with punctuation or grammar

💡It's primarily punctuation. Em dashes, en dashes, and hyphens are punctuation
marks (symbols) used to structure text. They interact with grammar (how phrases
and clauses connect), but they themselves are punctuation rather than
grammatical categories.
