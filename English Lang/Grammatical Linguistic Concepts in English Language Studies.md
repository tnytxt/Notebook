Grammatical / linguistic concepts in English language studies

  Below is a concise description of each item in the provided list, all of which
are grammatical or linguistic concepts commonly studied in English language
learning:
 * Adjective: A word that describes or modifies a noun, indicating its quality,
   quantity, or extent (e.g., "big," "blue," "three").
 * Adverb: A word that modifies a verb, adjective, or another adverb, often
   describing manner, place, time, or degree (e.g., "quickly," "there," "very").
 * Articles: Words ("a," "an," "the") that specify whether a noun is definite
   (specific) or indefinite (general).
 * Conditional Sentences: Sentences expressing hypothetical situations and their
   consequences, typically using "if" (e.g., "If it rains, we’ll stay home").
 * Gerund and Infinitive: Verb forms used as nouns; gerunds end in "-ing" (e.g.,
   "swimming"), infinitives are "to" + verb (e.g., "to swim").
 * Irregular Verbs: Verbs that don’t follow standard conjugation patterns for
   past tense or past participle (e.g., "go" → "went," "gone").
 * Modals and Modal Auxiliaries: Verbs like "can," "must," "should" that
   indicate ability, permission, obligation, or possibility.
 * Nouns: Words naming people, places, things, or ideas (e.g., "dog," "city,"
   "happiness").
 * Participles: Verb forms used as adjectives or to form certain tenses; present
   participles end in "-ing" (e.g., "running"), past participles often end in
   "-ed" (e.g., "finished").
 * Passive Voice: Sentence structure where the subject receives the action
   (e.g., "The book was read" vs. active "She read the book").
 * Phrasal Verbs: Verbs combined with prepositions or adverbs, creating new
   meanings (e.g., "give up," "look after").
 * Prepositions: Words showing relationships of time, place, or direction (e.g.,
   "in," "on," "under").
 * Pronouns: Words replacing nouns to avoid repetition (e.g., "he," "she," "it,"
   "they").
 * Punctuation: Marks like commas, periods, and quotation marks used to organize
   and clarify written language.
 * Quantifiers: Words indicating quantity or extent, used with nouns (e.g.,
   "some," "many," "few").
 * Questions: Sentences designed to elicit information, often using inversion or
   question words like "who," "what," "why."
 * Reported Speech: Conveying what someone said indirectly (e.g., "She said she
   was tired" vs. direct "I’m tired").
 * Sentences: Groups of words forming a complete thought, typically with a
   subject and predicate.
 * Verbs: Words describing actions, states, or occurrences (e.g., "run," "is,"
   "happen").
 * Tenses: Verb forms indicating when an action occurs, such as past, present,
   or future (e.g., "walked," "walk," "will walk").
 * Comparison of Tenses: Analyzing differences between verb tenses to understand
   their specific uses and nuances (e.g., present simple vs. present
   continuous).
