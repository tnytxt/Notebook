**Patrington near Withernsea**
The quaint village of Patrington sits perched on the edge of the Yorkshire Coast, where you can walk for miles along beautiful Blue Flag beaches and coastal nature reserves. It’s also home to some of the Yorkshire Coast’s most historic locations, including St Patrick’s Church - otherwise known as The Queen of Holderness.

###### May Beck and Failing Foss, Whitby
Stroll beneath the trees that line the paths of this two-mile woodland walk, leading you to the Failing Foss Waterfall, which spills from a huge 30-foot drop into the brook below. You’ll be in good company with the serene trickling from the May Beck flowing along the path.

**South Cliff Gardens, Scarborough**
Take a walk through the wooden slopes and have your pick from relaxed terraced walks to spectacular sea views. The gardens are filled with unseen treasures, and if you’re lucky enough to witness snowfall at the South Cliff Gardens - the views are an even more magical.

**Flamborough Head, Bridlington**
Marked by a stretch of rugged white cliffs surrounding a small village, this coastline is a great base for bird watching and hiking along windswept paths.

**Kilnsea Way, Withernsea**
A ramble along Spurn Point could keep you busy for days, but don’t overlook Kilnsea Way. The sandy, shingle banks make the walk flat and easily accessible. Start at the Discovery Centre and head to the [East Yorkshire](https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/topic/east-yorkshire) village of Kilnsea - a charming, small settlement that was of major importance during World War I.

**Hunmanby Gap, Filey**
Hunmanby Gap is perfect if you are looking for a quieter beach to visit near Filey. An all-year round dog friendly beach, this large, sandy expanse is ideal if you and your four-legged friend has had one too many treats. When walking along Hunmanby Gap, you will see a few intact pillboxes from World War II on the beach if you look in the direction of Filey.

**Forge Valley, Scarborough**
Great for both walkers and cyclists, the River Derwent slices the area in two - creating a fresh and vibrant place for natural flora, fauna and wildlife. It's also home to many different trails, including a geology trail that takes you through the woods, including plenty stopping places and information boards. You can find out more about the area or simply take the opportunity to do some ad-hoc wildlife spotting.

**The Cinder Track, Robin Hood’s Bay**
You can join at various points along the coast, but it’s recommended to join at Robin Hoods Bay to take in some of the lesser-known sights. From the Station car park at Robin Hood’s Bay simply follow the track north, taking in some fantastic sea and country views on the horizon.

**Ravenscar, Scarborough**
Explore the gardens and rugged coastal path in the area, which feels luxurious with the regal looking Raven Hall hotel perched on top of the clifftop. Whether you want a leisurely walk or a longer ramble, there’s something for everyone. Not to mention, the rocky beach coves are a great place for the fossil hunters.

**Filey Brigg**
An extraordinary natural landmark, its steep cliffs are 20 metres high and are made from pure sandstone and pure limestone. The biology and geology of Filey Brigg place is among Sites of Special Scientific Interest in North Yorkshire. Legend has it, you may even stumble upon the bones of a dragon on the long narrow peninsula.

**Saltwick Bay, Whitby**
At first glance, Saltwick Bay appears to be a majestic, sculpted bay that offers glorious views out to sea – and not much more. However, this could not be further from the truth. Saltwick Bay is packed with history, perfect for walking off those calories.
From the Saltwick Nab quarries to the wreck of the [Admiral Von Tromp](https://www.thewhitbyguide.co.uk/the-admiral-von-tromp-saltwick-bay/), this destination has several curious tales to be told. [Beach Guide to the Whitby Area](https://www.thewhitbyguide.co.uk/whitby-beaches/) also the

The charming promenade stretches the whole length of the seafront, with primed landscaped gardens, plenty of parking, and old wooden breakwaters.
