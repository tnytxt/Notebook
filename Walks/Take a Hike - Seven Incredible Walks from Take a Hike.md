## Seven incredible walks from Take a Hike

The brand-new BBC Two series **Take A Hike**, narrated by Rhod Gilbert, sees keen British walkers go head-to-head to showcase the most beautiful and jaw-dropping countryside walks the UK has to offer. The show travels to Devon, Northumbria and the Scottish Highlands and Islands - up rugged mountain trails, along stunning coastal paths, and through picturesque river valleys. Here are seven incredible walks from the series that will take your breath away.

Watch now on **BBC iPlayer.**

## An uphill hike with astounding views

**Stac Pollaidh, Scotland**

This challenging but spectacular walk will leave even the most experienced hiker breathless! Deep in the Highlands stands the intimidating Stac Pollaidh. Translating to ‘steep rock at the pool’, this beast lives up to its name. Although relatively short for a Scottish mountain at 612m, it’s not for the faint-hearted! At a comfortable 4.5km in length the walk is no marathon, but still poses a challenge with its steep hills and rocky ridges.

After a tough scramble to the peak of the mountain you will be rewarded with one of the most amazing views Scotland has to offer, overlooking remarkable lochs and the dramatic Scottish Highlands. Below the summit is a perfect spot to refuel with a picnic - you’ll definitely need it!

## A colourful, coastal walk which may look familiar…

**Tobermory, Isle Of Mull**

What’s the story in Tobermory? Set in the location of the beloved kids’ show Balamory, this delightful circular walk will be a hit with all ages. Beyond the iconic colourful houses lies a popular coastal walking route for locals. After following a path through wonderful woodland you will find yourself at the old Rubha nan Gall lighthouse. From here the views are astonishing, offering a beautiful sight over the water to the Ardnamurchan Peninsula and the most westerly point of the UK mainland. If you’re lucky you may be able to spot some wild otters! This trail presents a fantastic mix of woodland and coastline, proving there’s even more to the magic of Tobermory than its delightful rainbow houses.

## A Highland jaunt full of magic

**Glenfinnan and Loch Shiel, Scotland**

Harry Potter fans and history buffs alike will delight at this treasure of a walk. Starting at the impressive Glenfinnan monument, there’s an opportunity to climb the 18-metre tall structure and see the statue of the lone Highlander. Setting off on the craggy path up the glen, before long a magical view of the Glenfinnan Viaduct will appear. Popularised by the Harry Potter films, this twenty-one arched viaduct is impressive in its own right, and dominates the landscape. If you time your walk well you may even see the Hogwarts Express chugging down the track, in a cloud of steam! Climbing higher, you’ll see stunning views of Loch Shiel and the mountains, before descending down to the water’s edge.

Lovers of the sea, take note! This charming coastal walk from the fishing village of Boulmer is a real beauty. Hugging the coastline as it stretches north towards the village of Craster, this walk showcases the English landscape in all its glory. It snakes through farmland and over sandy beaches, with rolling hills on one side, and the North Sea on the other.

  
Over bridges, dunes and rock pools you’ll go, stopping at secret beaches for a spot to eat and finishing with a view of the dramatic Dunstanburgh Castle. Continue from here if you want to explore the ruins, or stop at the pub overlooking the water for a well-earned drink. What more could you ask for?

## A wild woodland walk in England’s largest forest

**Kielder, Northumbria**

This crowd-pleaser of a walk begins and ends at the beautiful Kielder Castle, the former hunting lodge of the Duke of Northumberland. And it’s no wonder he chose this spot! This 6.5km loop takes you through the natural habitats of ospreys, goshawks, otters, badgers, red squirrels and many more British species. The walk snakes through England’s largest man-made forest, home to some 150 million trees and stretching over 200 square miles. En route you will find a magnificent listed structure - the Kielder Viaduct - which overlooks the vast Kielder Reservoir. Combining fantastic woodland, historic sites, staggering reservoir views, and plenty of wildlife - this fantastic walk has something for everyone.

## An artistic tour of the Ilfracombe seaside

**Ilfracombe to Hele Bay, Devon**

For those with artistic flare, this isn’t a walk to miss! Starting in the seaside town of Ilfracombe which boasts artistic landmarks, it stretches along the picturesque North Devon coast to the lovely Hele Bay. Along the way, the eyebrow-raising Landmark Theatre (locally dubbed “Madonna’s Bra”) can be seen as an example of quirky architecture, before following the shoreline around to Damien Hirst’s enigmatic sculpture, “Verity”. This 66-foot statue of a pregnant woman holding a sword aloft towers over the coast, and simply can’t be missed. Continuing on the coast path, there are views across the Bristol Channel on a clear day, and you may even spot dolphins. With beautiful surroundings, elephant-shaped rocks, and cultural spots of interest, this walk is an artist’s paradise.

**Shaldon to Labrador Bay, Devon**

This walk is tucked away in a gorgeous corner of south Devon. Setting out from the beach in the village of Shaldon which overlooks the Teign estuary, this 8km hike will take you all the way to Labrador Bay. Pass through the haunting Smuggler’s Tunnel, which is rumoured to be where goods were carried to be hidden in nearby caves. Nowadays it serves as the primary route to a beautiful and secluded sandy beach. After a quick paddle, it’s time for a hike! Climbing 400ft above sea level up the tree-lined coastal path you will be rewarded for your hard work with breathtaking views of the coast. This walk is one of unrelenting beauty and frequent rewards, and will please any lover of the seaside!
