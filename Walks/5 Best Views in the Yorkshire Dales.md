> View down Dentdale

Whernside is the highest mountain in Yorkshire. It is regularly climbed from Ribblehead and as part of the Yorkshire [3 Peaks challenge](https://where2walk.co.uk/home/walking-challenges/yorkshire-3-peaks/). However the best way of climbing Whernside (and finding the views) is not via the traditional route but [from Dent](https://where2walk.co.uk/walk/whernside-from-dent/) to the west. Alternatively on the climb from Ribblehead do not take the stile but continue on the bridleway to Dentdale. At the Boot on the Wold turn up hill.

The best view comes before you meet the first of the Three Tarns. Turn right on a faint track leading to a tall [cairn](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=cairn&ia=web). The views down Dentdale are superb. The U shaped dale is wonderfully symmetrical surrounded by impressive fells. [Aye Gill Pie](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Aye+Gill+Pie&ia=web) on the right does not make the magic 2000 feet but Crag Hill to the left does and the Howgills in the distance have a number of the [Dales 30](https://www.dales30.co.uk/) mountains in their undervalued range.

#### Find the View

The walk up Whernside from Dent is described [here](https://where2walk.co.uk/walk/whernside-from-dent/). However this view can also be found from Whernside by extending the traditional climb by not crossing the stile and continuing on the bridleway towards Dent.

#### 2. Littondale from the track down to Halton Gill

Littondale has always been my favourite dale. It is no surprise that many TV companies use the dale for their film locations. The latest is the James Herriot TV series. Littondale is rarely busy as there are no ‘popular’, over promoted hikes, and no waterfalls to entice the visitor. It is simply peaceful and serene, a place to lose yourself in nostalgia and tradition. Practically there are plenty of dry stone walls, sheep and three of the most lovely villages in the Dales.

One of 5 best views in the Yorkshire Dales appears at the head of the dale, on the track that leads in to the hamlet of Halton Gill from Yockenthwaite. The view looks down Littondale towards [Darnbrook Fell](https://where2walk.co.uk/walk/fountains-fell/) with the River Skirfare and Halton Gill in the foreground.

Rather than just park and walk up the bridleway above Halton Gill, I strongly suggest to visitors spend time and take this [10 mile walk](https://where2walk.co.uk/walk/hidden-valleys-of-wharfedale/). As well as having one of the best views it is my favourite walk in the Yorkshire Dales. There is another excellent view on the walk out of Litton (the village) looking back over the attractive village and picture postcard scenery.

#### 3. Ingleborough Nature Reserve

>Crummackdale limestone pavement

On the eastern slopes of Ingleborough lie the best preserved limestone pavements in England. The pavements are quite extensive, a sea (which of course it was) of light grey rock stretching many miles. Little walked paths wind their way through these pavements, pretty routes of short grass making the most of the pleasant underfoot terrain.

The best of the lot, with the iconic view, is a short section of the [Dales High Way](https://where2walk.co.uk/home/long-distance-walks/a-dales-high-way/) between Long Scar and Nick Pot, around 800m long. Half way along the path rises a little above the pavements to the east and the sea of limestone seems to stretch all the way to Pen-y-Ghent in the distance. All that interrupts the view are two Hawthorn trees in the midst of the rock. It is a perfect spot.

#### Find the View

The path with the best views in this wonderful area of limestone pavements can be found on two walks: the climb of [Ingleborough](https://where2walk.co.uk/walk/ingleborough-and-gaping-gill/) and an exploration of [Crummackdale](https://where2walk.co.uk/walk/austwick-and-crummackdale-walk/).

#### 4. Hay Meadows at Muker

>Muker hay meadows

One of the specialities of the Yorkshire Dales is the colourful Hay and Flower Meadows that carpet the valley floors during May and June. The views when standing in the meadows is unique. The local authorities have worked closely with local farmers to protect these fields and the development and protection of the hay meadows is the result. The meadows are increasingly widespread. However my favourite are the flower meadows in Upper Swaledale and more specifically around the village of Muker.

The village of Muker is a typical Dales village, small with a pleasant village pub set amongst beautiful Yorkshire stone buildings. The meadows are between the village and the embryonic River Swale. Having walked through the fields of hay meadows continue the walk alongside the river in to the valley to the north where there you will find a choice of paths.

#### 5. Cautley Spout from the slopes of Yarlside

[![Yarlside looking south](https://where2walk.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Yarlside-looking-south-800x420.jpg)](https://where2walk.co.uk/walk/yarlside/)
>Yarlside looking south

Strictly this view is in the Cumbrian (not Yorkshire) Dales but as it is all part of the Yorkshire National Park it will do! The Howgills are an undervalued area for walking. If you do not know them, go and visit.

The best views of Cautley Spout is to climb the steep slopes of Yarlside from the Cross Keys temperance pub. The views across to the waterfalls are quite superb from the Yarlside climb, the highest cascade (multi drop) waterfall in England. From Yarlside you can see in to the depths of the waterfall with the slopes of the Calf above.

For those who cannot face the steep climb of Yarlside the track on the valley floor also yields excellent views of the waterfalls.

#### Honorary Mention

>Long Preston Beck

The area to the east of Long Preston has some outstanding views, particularly on the [**8 Stiles walk**](https://where2walk.co.uk/walk/eight-stiles-walk-around-long-preston/). Here the view back from the path above Long Preston Beck is a perfect scene, quintessentially English. Re-position this meeting of rivers near Malham and it would be heaving with visitors.
