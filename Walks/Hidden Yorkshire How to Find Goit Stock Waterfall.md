## Goit Stock Waterfall: The Secret Bradford Waterfall

West Yorkshire is not renowned for its waterfalls. But that’s what makes the few it has so special.

Because so few people know about them, West Yorkshire’s waterfalls make the best hidden and secluded spots.

Goit Stock Waterfall is one of those hidden gems.

Unless you were specifically seeking it out, you would never know it was there! So, it’s a good job you’re in the know…

Keep reading to learn more about Goit Stock Waterfall, plus everything you need to know about visiting the falls for yourself!

## What You Need To Know

**Location:** Goit Stock Waterfall is in Bingley in West Yorkshire. It is a 20-minute drive from the centre of Bradford or 45 minutes from the centre of Leeds.

**Where To Park:** There is a small number of on-road parking spaces available. They are located opposite The Malt pub on Wilsden Road BD16 1BG.

As you drive past the pub on your right, shortly ahead of you, you will see the parking indicated on the left-hand side. As there are only a few spaces available, it is advisable to arrive early.

**Walk Time:** Goit Stock Waterfall is located approximately 25 minutes from the recommended parking. If you want to go for a longer walk, the route can be extended beyond the waterfall.

**Terrain:** The first half of the walk is flat and paved, following a private road. Once you enter the woodland, the path becomes more muddy and uneven.

The final section of the walk to the waterfall is very rocky and would not be suitable for wheelchairs or pushchairs.

**What To Bring:** Because of the challenging terrain around the waterfall, sturdy walking shoes are advised. Your basic [**hiking essentials**](https://getlost.blog/hiking-essentials/) will be more than sufficient for this route.

If you want to pack a map for the route, you will require [**OS Explorer 288**](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=2495&awinaffid=723391&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.ordnancesurvey.co.uk%2Fmap-of-bradford-huddersfield%2F).

**When To Visit:** Goit Stock Waterfall can be accessed year-round. We visited in winter and parts of the track were frosty or muddy, making it slippery underfoot but the route was easily manageable.

The route is likely to get busy on weekend during warmer months.

## How To Find Goit Stock Waterfall

To locate the parking spaces, navigate to The Malt pub on Wilsden Road (BD16 1BG).

The on-road parking is located shortly beyond the pub if you pass with the pub on your right-hand side.

But spaces are limited, so you need to arrive early to avoid disappointment, especially on a weekend.

From the parking, follow the footpath back in the direction of The Malt, but don’t cross the road.

Shortly, on your right-hand side, you will see a private road called Goit Stock Lane. You want to take this road to start your journey to Goit Stock Waterfall.

As you follow the lane beyond the houses, you will join alongside Harden Beck.

You will catch a glimpse of a mini waterfall at the end of the houses, but you’ve not reached Goit Stock yet!

Can you imagine how charming it must be to live next to this waterfall?

![](https://getlost.blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Harden-Beck-Waterfall.jpg)

Your route alongside the beck will continue along a paved road.

At this stage, the walk is flat and easy to negotiate. Unless you’re like us and visit when the road is icy that is!

![How to get to Goit Stock Waterfall](https://getlost.blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/How-to-get-to-Goit-Stock-Waterfall.jpg)

The road will take you directly into a holiday park. Don’t worry, you’re still going the right way!

Simply follow the road straight ahead through the park. Eventually, the road will branch off past a house, then lead onto a woodland path beyond.

### Beyond The Holiday Park…

At the point that you enter the wood, you will re-join the beck, now on your right-hand side.

The route from here is fairly straightforward, as you simply follow the woodland path alongside the beck until you reach Goit Stock Waterfall.

![Goit Stock Waterfall Woodland Path](https://getlost.blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Goit-Stock-Waterfall-Woodland-Path.jpg)

As Goit Stock Waterfall begins to creep into view, the path becomes much rockier and more difficult to negotiate.

This is where your walking boots will come in handy! Take care on the rocks when they are wet as they get slippery.

So, after the scramble, you will reach Goit Stock Waterfall.

There are plenty of large rocks around the plunge pool, which you can take a seat on.

It’s a great spot to stop and admire the waterfall, take some photos, or grab a bite to eat! Just be sure to take all your rubbish away with you.

While you’re visiting the waterfall, be sure to scramble up the rocky climb next to the falls.

It is a little steep in parts though reasonably easy to negotiate in good footwear.

If you follow the stream just a short distance from the top of your climb, you will reach the upper falls.

These much smaller falls are far less dramatic than Goit Stock Waterfall but are equally as beautiful. It is worth the climb to witness them while you’re visiting.

## When To Visit

Goit Stock Waterfall can be accessed year-round.

We visited on a rather chilly, slightly snowy New Year’s Day! Parts of the track were frosty or muddy, making it slippery underfoot but the route was easily manageable.

I’d love to return in warmer months to see the woodland in full foliage. However, it is a popular location among locals. As such, I’d expect the route to be busy during the summer months.
