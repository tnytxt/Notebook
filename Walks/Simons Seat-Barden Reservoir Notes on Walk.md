Simon's seat-Barden reservoir

You go up the road in the Barden direction from Burnsall but then hook right through the woods half way up the hill and up onto Burnsall and Thorpe Fell. You take a westerly line open fell line from here and soon be able to pick up a cart track that continues west and then south around the edge of the fell before petering out. Keep following the ridge edge though and you pick up a good path from the war memorial which takes you to Rystone Cross. Soon after the Cross you pick up the main path coming up from Rylstone and you leave the ridge at this point and follow that east and south east all the way to the road at the cattle grid. Cross there and follow the path over Hare Head, Middle Hare Head and Little Hare Head before dropping down through the woods and appearing on the road at Bolton Abbey. Then down to the stepping stones and follow the tourist track through the woods, past the wooden bridge at Cavendish Pavilion before heading right through the fields, past the valley of desolation (drop down and visit the gorgeous waterfall) and all the way up to Simon's Seat. At Simon's Seat take the south westerly path down to Howgill, then down to the road (Stangs Lane) and then following the river all the way back to Burnsall
