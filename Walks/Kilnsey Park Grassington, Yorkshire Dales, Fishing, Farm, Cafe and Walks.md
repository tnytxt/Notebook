## [WELCOME TO KILNSEY PARK](https://kilnseypark.co.uk/plan-visit/)

Kilnsey Park is a beautiful outdoor attraction near Grassington in the heart of the Yorkshire Dales. Relax and recharge amidst the green space and breathtaking views of Upper Wharfedale, Great Whernside and the towering Crag that inspired painter Turner. Share with your family the excitement of catching a fish for the first time in our springwater-fed lakes. Come together to spend a tranquil day meeting our farm animals and our wonderful wildflowers, before treating yourself to our unique pink fish and chips and a well-earned Yorkshire Tea in the Café by the Lake.

We offer you a warm Yorkshire Dales welcome and hope you enjoy your visit.
