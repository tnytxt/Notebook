There is a rewarding five-mile walk round the outskirts of an East Yorkshire village which takes in a magical tunnel and ends with a crystal clear pond.

The walk between Nafferton and Wansford, near Driffield, takes you through country lanes and along a beautiful beck. It is worth pointing out at this stage that parking in Nafferton is a very thorny subject, however, and if you park in Nethergate, where the walk starts, do not go on the grass verges.

In Nethergate, there is a public footpath which takes you on a rather narrow path through some paddocks. At one point, the hedgerows almost envelop you and you walk through an almost Narnia-like natural tunnel. But be warned, it can be like a swamp during wetter times of the year

The field path will take you to Backcarr Lane, which you follow over a level crossing. Follow this track until you reach Hords Lane and turn right. Once you reach Carr Lane turn left until you see the sign for Wansford on your right.

Carry on this lane until you come to a bridge and you will see a public footpath sign just before it on your right. This is a particularly lovely part of the walk where you amble by the clear waters of Nafferton Beck and you can spot trout swimming against the current.

This lovely setting will carry all the way back to Nafferton. Cross New Bridge Lane, close to the train station, and over another level crossing which takes you over fields and to Priestgate. Carry on up the street and you will soon come to the gorgeous mere fed by the crystal clear springs. The water looks tropical and with blue sky you can almost picture an exotic Caribbean sea . . . just without the endless white sands.
