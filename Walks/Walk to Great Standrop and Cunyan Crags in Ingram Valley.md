A few years back when we were visiting [Linhope Spout](https://fabulousnorth.com/linhope-spout/), I spotted a cool and massive rock sprouting out of the nearby hillside and wondered what it was. Let me see if I can dig the photo out. Here we go.

![](https://cdn.fabulousnorth.com/fabulous-north/walk/20220225-124237-c41b68572fb.jpg?width=1200)

My naïve slightly younger self thought that it didn't look too far and wondered if I could nip to it. At the time I was just dressed in jeans and trainers, so fortunately I didn't attempt it.

A few years later when I started to get into hill walking I found out that it's called the [Great Standrop](https://fabulousnorth.com/great-standrop-and-little-standrop/) and sits on the edge of **Hedgehope Hill** which you can see to the right of the picture. It also has a sibling called **Little Standrop** next to it.

With a bit more nous and a canny few hills under my belt, I set off to conquer the **Great Standrop**. However it turned out to be my nemesis.

On attempt 1 I headed up via **Cunyan Crags** and it was super misty where at one stage I could only see around 50m in front of me. (See picture below).

On attempt 2, I had just ascended Hedgehope Hill as part of the [Cheviot and Hedgehope Hill walk](https://fabulousnorth.com/walks/cheviot-and-hedgehope-hill/), but as at that point I was 5 hours in and my feet were soaking from Comb Fell, so I just headed on and didn't make the diversion.

Attempt 3 was on a light sunny-ish day, but as soon as got half way up, the clouds formed on top of the hills and visibility was dire. I turned around and sulked back to the car.

![](https://cdn.fabulousnorth.com/fabulous-north/walk/20221004-122916-da35fe0633f.jpg?width=1200)

Today's forecast was bright sunshine and clear skies with a temperature of a whopping 10 degrees, so I donned the boots and made a statement that today was going to be the day that I visited the **Great Standrop**.

I also wanted to revisit **Cunyan Crags** in better conditions so the plan was to park at **Hartside** just before Linhope and head up to the crags on **Dunmoor Hill**, then along to **Cunyan Crags** before heading up **Hedgehope** and along to the **Great Standrop**.

![](https://cdn.fabulousnorth.com/fabulous-north/walk/20230418-090307-35748fcb58b.jpg?width=1200)

The view from the car park shows **Cat Crag** and **Long Crag** to the left of the hill and **Cunyan Crags** to the right. Weather looking good so far!

But then I pan over to **Hedgehope Hill** (middle hill in the distance) and there was a cloud cover on it. Damn!

![](https://cdn.fabulousnorth.com/fabulous-north/walk/20230418-090526-38483a3a356.jpg?width=1200)

With it being sunny I was hoping that any cloud or mist would burn off by the time I got there. Fingers crossed.

Just before I enter **Linhope Village** there is a little sign pointing to the **The Dod** which is beyond the crags, so I take the permissive path through the gates.

![](https://cdn.fabulousnorth.com/fabulous-north/walk/20230418-130139-fd27490b0fd.jpg?width=600)

![](https://cdn.fabulousnorth.com/fabulous-north/walk/20230418-130122-142e0e88701.jpg?width=600)

I follow the track and through a gate onto the open access land.

![](https://cdn.fabulousnorth.com/fabulous-north/walk/20230418-091531-6b1814a6b80.jpg?width=1200)

I catch sight of **Cat Crag** and **Long Crag** from the bottom of the hill and my route takes me to the left up the side of the hill.

![](https://cdn.fabulousnorth.com/fabulous-north/walk/20230418-092157-776cc8de34e.jpg?width=1200)

![](https://cdn.fabulousnorth.com/fabulous-north/walk/20230418-092557-ab3a7d99d18.jpg?width=1200)

Then half way up I catch my first glimpse of the **Great Standrop**. Crumbs that looks a long way away! You can just make out the **Little Standrop** next to it.

![](https://cdn.fabulousnorth.com/fabulous-north/walk/20230418-092648-f91562c1f5b.jpg?width=1200)

I pan the camera over and "Oh joy!" look at **Hedgehope Hill**, totally covered in cloud!

![](https://cdn.fabulousnorth.com/fabulous-north/walk/20230418-093034-e1975e02de5.jpg?width=1200)

Crossing fingers the sun will burn this off I persevere on and find a little **Slow Worm** enjoying the weather. Apparently the slow worm is neither a worm nor a snake, but is, in fact, a legless lizard.

![](https://cdn.fabulousnorth.com/fabulous-north/walk/20230418-093128-c61a94dacb8.jpg?width=1200)

And I am pretty much at **Cat Crag**.

![](https://cdn.fabulousnorth.com/fabulous-north/walk/20230418-093524-2960dbe4b23.jpg?width=1200)

![](https://cdn.fabulousnorth.com/fabulous-north/walk/20230418-093621-be88c7584fc.jpg?width=1200)

![](https://cdn.fabulousnorth.com/fabulous-north/walk/20230418-093959-9b6ebf1a2fa.jpg?width=1200)

Of course you have to climb it and some swell views from the top with **Long Crag** in the distance.

![](https://cdn.fabulousnorth.com/fabulous-north/walk/20230418-094102-263a0d1ac60.jpg?width=600)

![](https://cdn.fabulousnorth.com/fabulous-north/walk/20230418-094054-be53c49f740.jpg?width=600)

Cloud starting to clear, whoop!

![](https://cdn.fabulousnorth.com/fabulous-north/walk/20230418-094127-892623ccadc.jpg?width=1200)

I continue heading over to **Long Crag**.

![](https://cdn.fabulousnorth.com/fabulous-north/walk/20230418-094647-1a153503484.jpg?width=1200)

![](https://cdn.fabulousnorth.com/fabulous-north/walk/20230418-094949-8585af4c6f9.jpg?width=600)

Lots of other little fab crags knocking about too.

![](https://cdn.fabulousnorth.com/fabulous-north/walk/20230418-095053-69750e0acdc.jpg?width=1200)

![](https://cdn.fabulousnorth.com/fabulous-north/walk/20230418-094416-f431f1d5a9c.jpg?width=1200)

Well hello **Hedgehope Hill** with no cloud. And just peeking up behind it is **The Cheviot**.

![](https://cdn.fabulousnorth.com/fabulous-north/walk/20230418-095137-2df7ff2c5d5.jpg?width=1200)

I take a final few snaps of **Long Crag** and then I make the trek over the top of **Dunmoor Hill** to **Cunyan Crags**.

![](https://cdn.fabulousnorth.com/fabulous-north/walk/20230418-095303-7e2dc76917d.jpg?width=1200)

![](https://cdn.fabulousnorth.com/fabulous-north/walk/20230418-095344-3b8cbb57015.jpg?width=1200)

My [last walk to Cunyan Crags](https://fabulousnorth.com/walks/dunmoor-hill-and-cunyan-crags/) was in ludicrous rain and mist, so my photos weren't too great. Hopefully today they will be a lot clearer. A few more crags along the way.

![](https://cdn.fabulousnorth.com/fabulous-north/walk/20230418-095412-5ae47e803af.jpg?width=1200)

![](https://cdn.fabulousnorth.com/fabulous-north/walk/20230418-095820-e00c53d1709.jpg?width=600)

![](https://cdn.fabulousnorth.com/fabulous-north/walk/20230418-095523-d02e9a9d849.jpg?width=600)

![](https://cdn.fabulousnorth.com/fabulous-north/walk/20230418-095548-d5733e53746.jpg?width=1200)

From the top of **Dunmoor Hill** I get my first proper look at **Cunyan Crags**. Shrouded in mist! It's a canny jaunt down to the crags and then I have to retrace my steps back up, so I contemplate even making the journey at all. My adventuring feet get the better of me and I make the descent.

![](https://cdn.fabulousnorth.com/fabulous-north/walk/20230418-100139-96ddaa92213.jpg?width=1200)

Fortunately as I get nearer, the mist parts and I am left with glorious views of the crags. I up the pace and take a wadge of photos before it comes back.

![](https://cdn.fabulousnorth.com/fabulous-north/walk/20230418-100534-34d34c86f4d.jpg?width=1200)

![](https://cdn.fabulousnorth.com/fabulous-north/walk/20230418-100851-81115e1036c.jpg?width=1200)

![](https://cdn.fabulousnorth.com/fabulous-north/walk/20230418-100926-13b82d80a8e.jpg?width=1200)

The mist seems to be keeping at bay so I snap away.

![](https://cdn.fabulousnorth.com/fabulous-north/walk/20230418-100959-f3d5c62264f.jpg?width=1200)

![](https://cdn.fabulousnorth.com/fabulous-north/walk/20230418-101225-79a25a768aa.jpg?width=1200)

Just a few more photographs.

![](https://cdn.fabulousnorth.com/fabulous-north/walk/20230418-101229-b0c42c74de4.jpg?width=1200)

![](https://cdn.fabulousnorth.com/fabulous-north/walk/20230418-101513-3d785d09f0c.jpg?width=600)

![](https://cdn.fabulousnorth.com/fabulous-north/walk/20230418-101441-b813cae635e.jpg?width=600)

If you squint on the top of the hill in the distance you will see **Langlee Crags** which are to the north east of **Hedgehope Hill**. There are a plethora of crags around there so I am saving those for another adventure.

Since this post I have now visited these other crags and you can read about it here - [Crags Around Hedgehope Hill And Langleeford](https://fabulousnorth.com/walks/crags-around-hedgehope-hill-and-langleeford/).

![](https://cdn.fabulousnorth.com/fabulous-north/walk/20230418-101551-8c5fbd1c194.jpg?width=1200)

My route now retraces my steps back up to the top of **Dunmoor Hill**, and peeking back, **Cunyan Crags** are still looking resplendent**.**.

![](https://cdn.fabulousnorth.com/fabulous-north/walk/20230418-102519-46980f39c49.jpg?width=1200)

And more importantly, **Hedgehope Hill** is clear!

![](https://cdn.fabulousnorth.com/fabulous-north/walk/20230418-103107-d43f26e2033.jpg?width=1200)

![](https://cdn.fabulousnorth.com/fabulous-north/walk/20230418-104225-3a6eb527617.jpg?width=1200)

A much better view of **Great Standrop** and **Little Standrop**. I'm getting nearer.

![](https://cdn.fabulousnorth.com/fabulous-north/walk/20230418-104317-1c134e8025c.jpg?width=1200)

Now in the valley between **Dunmoor Hill** and **Hedgehope Hill** and time to ascend. It's a bit boggy already!

![](https://cdn.fabulousnorth.com/fabulous-north/walk/20230418-104820-8c6301ae771.jpg?width=1200)

Getting a lot closer now. One thing that is not easy to see until you're actually up here is that there is a chunky ravine where the **Het Burn** flows between here and the **Great Standrop**, so it would be difficult to just cross country over to it from here. So I head up to the top of **Hedgehope Hill** and them down its southern face.

![](https://cdn.fabulousnorth.com/fabulous-north/walk/20230418-105947-e4b9550b36e.jpg?width=1200)

![](https://cdn.fabulousnorth.com/fabulous-north/walk/20230418-105950-ca1a1657762.jpg?width=1200)

![](https://cdn.fabulousnorth.com/fabulous-north/walk/20230418-112424-c7e8d9283cd.jpg?width=1200)

**The Cheviot** looking glorious as always.

![](https://cdn.fabulousnorth.com/fabulous-north/walk/20230418-112854-3b50724b94f.jpg?width=1200)

Even though these Standrop crags are just on the south face of **Hedgehope Hill**, they are still a canny trek away. 1.5km to be precise.

![](https://cdn.fabulousnorth.com/fabulous-north/walk/20230418-112857-3c17ddda3d5.jpg?width=1200)

![](https://cdn.fabulousnorth.com/fabulous-north/walk/20221108-143146-a45fe3cd46b.jpg?width=1200)

After a bit of a descent through some heather I find a track that is heading straight for **Little Standrop**.

![](https://cdn.fabulousnorth.com/fabulous-north/walk/20230418-114315b-4fee0c2b312.jpg?width=1200)

![](https://cdn.fabulousnorth.com/fabulous-north/walk/20230418-114536b-fa486e57d55.jpg?width=1200)

From the top I can make out **Cat Crag** and **Long Crag** on **Dunmoor Hill** along with **The Cheviot** and of course, **Great Standrop**.

![](https://cdn.fabulousnorth.com/fabulous-north/walk/20230418-114540-15bf10ba02c.jpg?width=1200)

![](https://cdn.fabulousnorth.com/fabulous-north/walk/20230418-114640-200f3b144bf.jpg?width=1200)

![](https://cdn.fabulousnorth.com/fabulous-north/walk/20230418-115121b-0962c54993e.jpg?width=1200)

Time to meet my nemesis and with a quick look back to **Little Standrop** and **Hedgehope Hill** I head up between the twin peaks.

![](https://cdn.fabulousnorth.com/fabulous-north/walk/20230418-114953-a5284972b41.jpg?width=1200)

![](https://cdn.fabulousnorth.com/fabulous-north/walk/20230418-115410-d78dbf50cae.jpg?width=1200)

![](https://cdn.fabulousnorth.com/fabulous-north/walk/20230418-115414-6aedc363f6b.jpg?width=1200)

Absolutely spectacular views everywhere I look from up here.

![](https://cdn.fabulousnorth.com/fabulous-north/walk/20230418-120236-6ebcfe1d92f.jpg?width=1200)

![](https://cdn.fabulousnorth.com/fabulous-north/walk/20230418-120221-0284453af9d.jpg?width=1200)

With a triumphant and virtual punch of the air, I head down and back towards the valley floor on my way to **Linhope Spout**. A little look back and maybe a wave as I leave the **Great Standrop** behind.

![](https://cdn.fabulousnorth.com/fabulous-north/walk/20230418-120559-c6d11ead978.jpg?width=1200)

![](https://cdn.fabulousnorth.com/fabulous-north/walk/20230418-121029-f0e9c2a1bf9.jpg?width=1200)

Heading down I get another look at the crags on **Dunmoor Hill** and I head towards the **Het Burn** that will join with the **Linhope Burn** to go over the falls.

![](https://cdn.fabulousnorth.com/fabulous-north/walk/20230418-121304-5808146037d.jpg?width=1200)

![](https://cdn.fabulousnorth.com/fabulous-north/walk/20230418-121446-57665674409.jpg?width=1200)

Fully down from the hills I meet up with **Linhope Burn** just before it heads over **Linhope Spout**.

![](https://cdn.fabulousnorth.com/fabulous-north/walk/20230418-123233-d080d3de7fd.jpg?width=1200)

I'm now right over the falls and I keep a tight hold on my camera!

![](https://cdn.fabulousnorth.com/fabulous-north/walk/20230418-123237-c89e3766261.jpg?width=1200)

![](https://cdn.fabulousnorth.com/fabulous-north/walk/20230418-123258-c5ece5ad1aa.jpg?width=1200)

I'm a bit toasty now, but I still don't think I could be tempted for a dip.

![](https://cdn.fabulousnorth.com/fabulous-north/walk/20230418-123726-ff7e6dd6276.jpg?width=1200)

Looking up to [Great Standrop](https://fabulousnorth.com/great-standrop-and-little-standrop/) from **Linhope Spout** I recreate the photo that started this obsession in the first place!

![](https://cdn.fabulousnorth.com/fabulous-north/walk/20230418-124028b-b63c42e67df.jpg?width=1200)

Then from **Linhope Spout** it's just a matter of heading through **Linhope Village** and following the road back to the car. Couldn't help but take one final picture of **Cat Crag**, **Long Crag** and **Cunyan Crags**.

![](https://cdn.fabulousnorth.com/fabulous-north/walk/20230418-131057-79e4b9a7238.jpg?width=1200)

Another cracking wander out in **Ingram Valley** and finally bagging the **Great Standrop**!
