The Goit Stock Waterfall can be found in between Harden, Wilsden and Cullingworth, slightly north west of the centre of Bradford.

TripAdvisor visitors have praised the "stunning" and "beautiful" area after visiting for a walk. Reviewer Linda wrote: "Very nice place for a walk, nature is so beautiful with the sound of the waterfall and birds. It's so amazing when sun get through the trees... fairytale."

Similarly, Andy Britton wrote: "Goit Stock falls is a fantastic place. A bit of a walk to get to them but the scenery is great. Lovely place for all ages from young children to us older folk."

The walk up to the waterfall is suitable for children and dogs alike.

So how can you get there without driving? Here's the quickest way to get to Goit Stock Waterfall from the major cities in Yorkshire.

### Bradford  

Being the nearest city to the waterfall, this one's the most straight-forward. Head to Bradford Interchange Bus Station and grab the 616 service.

This will take you all the way up the B6144. After 43 stops, get off at Wilsden Road Goit Stock Terrace.

From there, it's a nice walk to the waterfall alongside Hallas Beck- the whole thing will take you around 40 minutes.

### Leeds  

It's also pretty simple to get from Leeds to the falls. Grab a train from Leeds Train Station up to Bingley.

Once you arrive, exit Bingley station and catch the 616 service heading towards Bradford from Park Road Wellington Street. From there, ride just nine stops to Wilsden Road Goit Stock Terrace.

Again, from there you just need to walk along Hallas Beck for a quarter of an hour to reach the waterfall. This journey should take you just over 45 minutes.

### Huddersfield  

It's a little bit longer from Huddersfield as the fastest route is just to get the train into Leeds and then follow the steps above. This should take about an hour and a half.

If you fancy busing it the whole way instead, get the X63 from Huddersfield bus station to Bradford bus station, and then follow the steps from Bradford outlined above.

This one will take you not much longer at about an hour and three-quarters.

### Sheffield & York  

There's probably closer waterfalls you could visit from these two - but if you're really raring to get to Goit Stock, grab the train into Leeds and then follow the steps above.

### Getting back  

The quickest way to get home again is to walk back to where you came from and grab the 616 to either Bingley or Bradford Bus Interchange, depending on where you're heading after that.

If you decide to walk a bit further beyond the waterfall, there are other ways to get home. Heading along Cow House Beck will eventually take you into Cullingworth.

If you end up here, grab the 67 service from Cullingworth War Memorial into Keighley. From here, you can grab a bus or train to the rest of Yorkshire.
