- Nidderdale Greenway - Harrogate to Ripley Cycle Route

This short and sweet ride passes wildflower meadows, gorgeous woodland and golden wheat fields. On its 4-mile length you’ll travel over the stunning Grade 2-listed, seven-arch Nidd Gorge Viaduct. This is a wonderful place to pause and admire the views.

This route connects Bilton, North Harrogate, and Knaresborough with Ripley on a fantastic 4-mile converted railway line. Along this short and gentle ride the North Yorkshire countryside is golden with wheat fields in the summer and ablaze with the amber leaves of the surrounding woodland in autumn.

As well as developing the traffic-free path, this route development included bringing back into use the Grade 2 listed, seven-arch Nidd Gorge Viaduct. When you cross the viaduct make sure you pause to enjoy the glorious views over the fields and towards the thick coniferous forest that spreads across the nearby hillside.

On the Nidderdale Greenway you’ll pass lovely woodland, which in spring is carpeted with bluebells and in summer you’ll be treated to views of yellow and purple wildflower meadows.
