Here is a **simple, child-friendly prompt** you can reuse in the future. It avoids technical language and explains exactly what you want in plain terms.

You can copy and paste this as-is.

**Prompt:**

> I have a folder on my computer called `~/notebook`.
> Inside it are text files written in Markdown.
>
> I want to keep this folder safe by copying it to GitHub, like a backup that updates when I change things.
>
> Please explain:
>
> * What Git and GitHub are, using very simple words
> * How to connect my folder to GitHub step by step
> * Exactly what commands I need to type in the terminal
> * How to update GitHub after I change a file
>
> Assume I have never used Git before.
> Explain slowly, clearly, and like you are teaching a child.

If you want an even shorter version:

> Explain how to back up my `~/notebook` folder to GitHub using very simple steps and words. I have never used Git before.

You can reuse this prompt any time you want a beginner-level explanation.
