**The Jaguar XJ** is one of the most iconic luxury saloons in British automotive history. The Jaguar XJ6 debuted in 1968, designed under [Sir William Lyons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lyons) Jaguar’s founder. It replaced several older saloon models with a single flagship, bringing together elegance, comfort, and performance in one car.

Early XJ models featured smooth inline-six engines (2.8L or 4.2L) and clean, graceful styling that quickly defined modern Jaguar luxury. In 1972, the XJ12 introduced a V12 engine, making it the fastest four-door production car in the world at the time and reinforcing Jaguar’s reputation for engineering ambition.

The XJ was created to replace four existing Jaguar saloons, combining the best elements of each. Advertising focused on its rare balance of refinement and driving pleasure, perfectly capturing Jaguar’s long-standing motto: **“Grace, Space, Pace.”**

During the 1970s and early 1980s, Jaguar faced serious industrial and quality challenges. Despite this, advertising for the Series II and Series III XJ worked hard to preserve the car’s prestige. Rather than selling the XJ as a practical purchase, adverts presented it as an aspiration — a reward for success. One famous Series III slogan **“Jaguar XJ. Some day, Some day.”** reinforced the idea of the car as a lifelong ambition, even while build quality issues were widely known.

As one of the very few V12-powered saloons in the world, the XJ12 was promoted as something truly exclusive. Advertising highlighted both its engineering sophistication and effortless performance, using sleek, understated imagery to suggest luxury and power without excess.

The launch of the all-new XJ40 in 1986 marked a shift. With fresh investment under Ford ownership, advertising moved toward themes of renewed engineering, technology, and reliability. The more angular XJ40 design was presented as a modern British alternative to German rivals such as BMW and Mercedes-Benz.

By the mid-1990s, Jaguar returned to a more traditional, rounded design under Ford. Advertising for the X308 emphasised a blend of heritage and improved build quality, alongside the smooth, refined performance of the new V8 engine — signalling that Jaguar had rediscovered its confidence while addressing past shortcomings.
