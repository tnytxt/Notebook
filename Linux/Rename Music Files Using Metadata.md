You can add the embedded metadata from music files to their filenames.

## To add metadata to a filename:

1.  Select two or more music files in Files.
    
2.  Press F2 or right-click on the selection and pick Rename. The Rename window opens with Rename using a template selected.
    
    The name field contains "\[Original filename\]" as a placeholder. It can be deleted or added back from the \+ Add menu.
    
3.  Click \+ Add to show the menu of available metadata, like Album and Title. Select each item to place it into the filename template in the order you want.
    
    The preview list will show the current filenames on the left and the resulting filenames on the right.
    
4.  Click the Rename button to apply the pattern you have created, and the files will be renamed.
    

If you renamed the wrong file, or named your file improperly, you can undo the rename. To revert the action, immediately click the menu button in the sidebar and select Undo Rename, or press Ctrl+Z, to restore the former name.
