# Panhard Rod Suspension Explained

The Panhard rod (also known as a Panhard link or track bar) is a simple suspension component used to locate a solid rear axle laterally, preventing it from shifting side-to-side relative to the chassis during cornering or body roll.

Here's a clear breakdown of the issue commonly seen in cars like the Nissan Micra when lowering the vehicle:

## The Problem with Lowering on a Stock Panhard Rod
When the car is at stock ride height, the Panhard rod is typically near-horizontal, keeping the axle centered.

When the suspension compresses (e.g., over bumps) or when the car is lowered using shorter springs (without adjusting the rod), the rod becomes angled. This causes the axle to shift laterally:

- One wheel tucks inward under the fender.
- The other wheel protrudes outward beyond the fender.

This offset worsens handling, causes uneven tire wear, and can make the car look asymmetrical.

Additionally, in multi-link rear suspensions like the Micra's, lateral axle shift alters rear toe alignment—one wheel may toe in while the other toes out dramatically, further degrading handling and accelerating tire wear.












#### The Solution: Adjustable Panhard Rod
An adjustable-length Panhard rod allows you to shorten it to match the lowered ride height, restoring proper centering when the suspension is at rest (uncompressed).

- This minimizes static offset.
- Dynamic offset during bumps/compression is unavoidable with this design but is small enough not to be a major issue if set up correctly.

Many aftermarket options (e.g., from Whiteline) are recommended for lowered setups.








#### Advanced Alternative: Watts Link
More sophisticated designs, like the Watts linkage used on some rear-wheel-drive Ford Falcons (and certain performance trucks), eliminate lateral shift almost entirely.

It uses a central pivot with bell-cranks, keeping the axle centered through the full range of travel.








The Panhard rod is a cost-effective, simple design that's easy to optimize with an adjustable version—making it reliable for most street and moderate performance applications. For more details on Micra-specific setups, check forums like [micra.hl.com.au](http://www.micra.hl.com.au/).
