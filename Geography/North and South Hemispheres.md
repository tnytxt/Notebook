North & south Hemispheres

  There are two sides to the equator: the Northern Hemisphere and the Southern
Hemisphere.


NORTHERN HEMISPHERE

 * Location: This is the half of the Earth that lies north of the equator.
 * Characteristics: It includes parts of North America, Europe, Asia, and
   northern Africa. The climate varies widely, but it generally experiences four
   distinct seasons in many regions.


SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE

 * Location: This is the half of the Earth that lies south of the equator.
 * Characteristics: It includes parts of South America, Africa, Australia, and
   the Pacific Islands. The climate here also varies, but many regions
   experience milder winters and warmer summers compared to the Northern
   Hemisphere.


KEY POINTS

 * The equator serves as a reference point for latitude, with locations north of
   it having positive latitude values and those south of it having negative
   values.
 * The equator influences climate, weather patterns, and biodiversity on both
   sides, leading to distinct ecological zones.
