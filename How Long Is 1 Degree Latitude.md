# How long is 1 degree latitude

The 1 degree of latitude is located above equator and the distance from equator is approximately 111 kms.(it’s little varying because of rotation of earth) Each degree have same distance from the equator to the pole (0 degree to 90 degrees N/S).The Earth is widest at its Equator. The distance around the Earth at the Equator, its circumference, is **24,901 miles**. The Earth's diameter is also wider at the Equator. The equator is longest and Antarctic and Arctic circles are smallest line.

The equator is about 24,800 miles. There are are 360° in a circle. Divide 24,800 miles by 360° to get 68 8/9 miles per degree.


A degree of latitude is 60 nautical miles. That’s why aviation still use knots (nautical miles per hour). A navigational chart does not need a scale; the latitude annotation at the right edge automagically provides that.

The meter was defined in terms of latitudinal distances, but the knot and nautical mile have, for whatever reason, predominated.
