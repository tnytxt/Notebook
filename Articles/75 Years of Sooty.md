## 75 Years of Sooty

![Sooty](https://cdn.comedy.co.uk/images/library/comedies/900x450/s/sooty_sweep_soo.jpg)

> "Izzy wizzy, let's get busy!"

The words themselves were usually spoken by one of three people: [Harry Corbett](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/harry_corbett/ "Harry Corbett profile"), his son [Matthew Corbett](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/matthew_corbett/ "Matthew Corbett profile") and magician [Richard Cadell](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/richard_cadell/ "Richard Cadell profile"). But the mute yellow bear that casts the spell?

That would be Sooty.

And cast a spell he did. That mantra has been screamed by kids, parents, grandparents and great-grandparents at the television and in theatres for a whopping seventy five years. Collating all the variant TV formats together, Sooty is the longest-running children's programme in the world.

His success can be attributed to many things - some would say it's the characters, some would say it's the childish joy it brings to generation upon generation, but the real answer, according to current right hand man Cadell, is Sooty's simplicity. The gags he does with the gang on television now are the same ones Harry did in the 1950s, when Sooty genuinely did have soot dabbed on his ears so he would show up on black and white television (hence the name), and they still make children and adults alike shriek with laughter.

### So where did it all begin?

[Harry Corbett](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/harry_corbett/ "Harry Corbett profile") was the nephew of famous fish and chip mogul Harry Ramsden, for whom he played piano in his restaurants. Music was his chosen career path, though sadly deafness in one ear precluded him from pursuing it professionally. His day job saw him work for Leeds City Council as an engineer and he'd also honed a one hour magic act, which he performed for extra money in the evenings.

>Matthew, Harry and Marjorie Corbett in 1964 as Soo was first introduced.

**Then, on 19th July** [1948](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1948/ "A guide to the year 1948"), the Corbett family - which, by this time, was made up of Harry's wife Marjorie and sons David and Peter, the latter of whom would change his name professionally to Matthew - while holidaying in Blackpool, happened upon a novelty shop on the North Pier. Corbett's eye was caught by a yellow bear puppet. According to a Guardian article published in [1987](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1987/ "A guide to the year 1987"), Corbett recalled the moment, saying "Even now I can't tell you exactly what it was about him, but I just couldn't leave him". He bought the bear for seven shillings and sixpence.

It would be the best investment of his life.

Christening the bear Teddy, Corbett initially only used it to entertain his two sons, only later incorporating the puppet into his magic shows. Before long, the bear's antics were so popular he restructured the entire act around it.

A little-known fact is that Harry and Sooty owe a huge debt of gratitude to Violet Carson, better known as hair-netted harridan [Ena Sharples](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Ena+Sharples)
 in *Coronation Street*. One of Harry's neighbours was Barney Colehan, then the producer of *Have A Go*, a popular radio quiz hosted by [Wilfred Pickles](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/wilfred_pickles/ "Wilfred Pickles profile"), with Carson playing piano. The Government wanted to send the quiz on a tour of northern coalfields to boost miners' morale, but Carson wanted nothing to do with it. Remembering his neighbour played the piano, Harry was duly booked in her place. The ensuing tour saw the teddy puppet portion of his act hugely popular with the audiences, and Harry credited those shows with teaching much of the vital stagecraft he would use for the rest of his career.

Renamed Sooty, the bear made his television debut in [1952](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1952/ "A guide to the year 1952") on the BBC Talent Night, which led to appearances on [Peter Butterworths](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/peter_butterworth/ "Peter Butterworths profile") *Saturday Special* soon thereafter. Spotting the further potential of the puppet, the BBC offered Corbett his own series, which began in [1955](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1955/ "A guide to the year 1955").

>The Sooty Show. Harry Corbett.

His only real rival on children's television at the time was *Muffin The Mule*, a popular equine marionette, but because Harry was so vehement in registering all the copyrights, a range of merchandising, as well as appearing in an television advert for Oxo, meant that Sooty quickly turned into a sensation eclipsing his opposite number.

The template of [The Sooty Show](https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/the_sooty_show/ "The Sooty Show: 1952 - 1992 BBC One sitcom. Click for a guide.") was quickly established. Harry was the weary, browbeaten father to Sooty, a five year-old boy who happened to be a teddy bear. Each episode saw Sooty attempt to accomplish some task or other, usually ending with Sooty covering Harry in condiments, and frequently shooting him with his now iconic water pistol.

So famous was the water pistol, in fact, that when Harry and Sooty appeared at The British Industries Fair at London Olympia, it made front page news when he squirted Prince Philip (he very nearly went for [The Queen](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/gerry-connolly/ "AKA Gerry Connolly. Click to view profile."), but Harry felt he shouldn't on account of her wearing velvet). Harry later recalled that Her Majesty "howled with laughter".

Harry thought of Sooty as part of the family to the extent that he would drill air holes into Sooty's box and only lay him face up. The family once went on holiday, and upon discovering they'd left Sooty at home, Harry cried "I can't go without him!". He would bring Sooty to meetings, and even perform with his bare hands if Sooty wasn't with him. In fact, so important were Harry's hands that he had his thumb and two fingers insured at a premium of £150 a year.

It was around this time that Harry signed a deal to make forty short *Sooty* films for Disney. The films were shown coast to coast in America on *Micky's Club House* and quickly developed a cult following.

With Sooty becoming more popular, and Harry running out of magic tricks he could have him do, in [1957](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1957/ "A guide to the year 1957") he decided to steer the show closer towards the sitcom format we know and love today. For this, he needed a new character.

### Enter Sweep

![Sweep](https://cdn.comedy.co.uk/images/library/comedies/900x450/t/the_sooty_show_2018.jpg)

The calamitous canine whose squeak can only be understood by a select few, his original puppeteer (and Harry's brother) Leslie Corbett achieved the sound through the use of a saxophone reed. The double act propelled Sooty to even greater heights, with the bickering, brotherly relationship paving the way for even more slapstick.

It was [1964](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1964/ "A guide to the year 1964") when the triumvirate was completed with the addition of Soo, a panda who was originally voiced and operated by Harry's wife Marjorie. It also meant that there was someone for Harry to interact with more clearly, as Sooty couldn't talk and Sweep only squeaked. Other characters were also introduced, like Ramsbottom, a snake who spoke in a rich Yorkshire dialect; Butch, a fearsome bulldog; and the little remembered Kipper the Cat.

The final episode of [The Sooty Show](https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/the_sooty_show/ "The Sooty Show: 1952 - 1992 BBC One sitcom. Click for a guide.") to air on the [BBC](https://www.comedy.co.uk/pro/blackbook/companies/bbc/ "Find out more about BBC") was a Christmas special in [1967](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1967/ "A guide to the year 1967"), after which the unthinkable happened - the cancelled Sooty, reportedly after a creative disagreement over the series' ongoing format. Luckily, [Thames Television](https://www.comedy.co.uk/pro/blackbook/companies/thames_television/ "Find out more about Thames Television") were ready to swoop in and save the day, so the Corbetts made the move to ITV, where the series still resides today.

[1973](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1973/ "A guide to the year 1973") saw Harry and Sooty join the ranks of showbiz royalty by appearing as guests on [The Morecambe And Wise Show](https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/the_morecambe_and_wise_show/ "The Morecambe And Wise Show: 1961 - 1968 ITV1 sketch show with Morecambe & Wise. Click for a guide.") (Series 7, Episode 11). The sketch saw the pair attempt to perform [The Sooty Show](https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/the_sooty_show/ "The Sooty Show: 1952 - 1992 BBC One sitcom. Click for a guide."), complete with Eric in a life-size Sooty costume.

As well as appearing as the Prime Minister and Home Secretary in a special episode of [The Goodies](https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/the_goodies/ "The Goodies: 1970 - 1982 BBC Two sitcom about three men. Click for a guide.") entitled *The Goodies Rule - O.K?*, [1975](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1975/ "A guide to the year 1975") was a landmark year for Sooty, and not for the nicest of reasons. On Christmas Day, Harry suffered a huge heart attack that would put him out of action for the next year. Matthew, by this point establishing a career as a children's entertainer in his own right by appearing as a presenter on *Rainbow*, was entrusted to take over presenting the following Christmas special.

However, it was not all plain sailing behind the scenes. Matthew would eventually buy the rights from his father (to the tune of a reported £35,000) under the condition that he stop performing with Sooty completely, in order to enable Matthew to establish himself as Sooty's new right-hand man. However, Harry continued to tour, culminating with father and son appearing on the same night in rival theatres in the East of England, Harry realised it was finally time to wind things down. He continued to make guest appearances *alongside* Matthew in the show and he performed on stage right up to the very end - his final performance was at the Pavilion Theatre in Weymouth on 15th August [1989](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1989/ "A guide to the year 1989"). He died two days later.

It wasn't until the [1980](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1980/ "A guide to the year 1980") Christmas special that Matthew established the formula that would ensure the show ran under his stewardship until [1998](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1998/ "A guide to the year 1998"). He dispensed with all extra elements, and moved the characters into a house, complete with their own bedroom. This setup enabled the show to morph into a fully-fledged sitcom, with the gang embarking on some kind of adventure each week. [1981](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1981/ "A guide to the year 1981") was the year that [Brenda Longman](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/brenda_longman/ "Brenda Longman profile") took over the voice of Soo, a role she still perfoms to this day, also appearing as Mo in [Sooty & Co.](https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/sooty_co/ "Sooty & Co.: 1993 - 1998 ITV1 sitcom. Click for a guide."), Dotty in [Sooty Heights](https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/sooty-heights/ "Sooty Heights: 1999 - 2004 ITV1 sitcom. Click for a guide.") and in various episodes of the current [Sooty](https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/sooty/ "Sooty: 2011 - 2018 ITVBe sitcom about a group of puppets. Click for a guide.") show.

One memorable episode during the [Matthew Corbett](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/matthew_corbett/ "Matthew Corbett profile") era is *Sweep's Family*, which saw Sweep's brothers and cousins, including Swoop, Swap and Swipe, come to stay; the ensuing mayhem of a seemingly uncountable number of squeaking grey dogs really has to be seen to be believed.

Fourteen years before he took over Matthew's role, a teenage [Richard Cadell](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/richard_cadell/ "Richard Cadell profile") guest starred in the [1985](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1985/ "A guide to the year 1985") Christmas Special as a magician. In fact, this episode is a perfect example of the magic of Sooty: it saw Matthew and Sooty perform for children in hospital. As a viewer, witnessing the power of that little yellow bear as he instantly cheers up patients, nurses, parents, and everyone else who crosses his path, is absolutely delightful.

>Richard Cadell

[1987](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1987/ "A guide to the year 1987") saw [Brian Sandford](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/brian_sandford/ "Brian Sandford profile") join the team to play Sweep, and like Longman he not only still plays him to this day but also appears in various supporting roles in the television series.

It's perhaps no surprise that Sooty has seen his fair share of famous fans and guest stars over the years. Matthew claimed in Geoff Tibballs' wonderful book *The Secret Life Of Sooty* that he is particularly proud of making [Spike Milligan](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/spike_milligan/ "Spike Milligan profile") laugh with his script for *Sootograms*, a [1986](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1986/ "A guide to the year 1986") episode that saw [The Goons](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/all_genres/all_channels/0/The+Goons/ "Click for a list of guides that match The Goons.") star partake in some classic Sooty slapstick. The foreword to the aforementioned book was written by unlikely Sooty superfan [George Harrison](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/george_harrison/ "George Harrison profile") - who explained that he once had to ask Matthew for his autograph because [Ringo Starr](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/ringo_starr/ "Ringo Starr profile") was a huge fan!

Iron Maiden drummer Nicko McBrain participated in a drum-off with Sooty in [1988](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1988/ "A guide to the year 1988") episode *Hidden Talent*; to this day McBrain keeps a Sooty puppet on his drums during concerts. In the same year, [Carry On](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/group/carry_on/ "Click to find out more about Carry On.") stalwart [Bernard Bresslaw](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/bernard_bresslaw/ "Bernard Bresslaw profile") appeared *Sooty's Magic Lamp*.

[1988](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1988/ "A guide to the year 1988") was also the year that childhood icons collided, when Sooty himself became a guest star, appearing in *Hobbies*, an episode in the second series of [ChuckleVision](https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/chucklevision/ "ChuckleVision: 1987 - 2009 BBC One sitcom about mishap-prone brothers. Click for a guide."). Bringing things full circle, [Richard Cadell](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/richard_cadell/ "Richard Cadell profile") toured with The Chuckle Brothers in the 1990s, again performing his magic act.

Not only did Matthew write and star in the television show during this period, but he also penned a number of Sooty stage plays, further boosting the bear's popularity. These included *Sooty's Creepy Castle*, *Sooty's Picnic* and *Sooty In Space*. Corbett co-starred in the shows with Connie Creighton, a frequent guest star in the television series. For the latter half of each year, while Matthew was busy writing and recording the television series, Creighton would co-present the live show with Spencer K. Gibbens. Cadell continues the trend of mixing both live and broadcast outings, with a special 75th anniversary stage tour planned for later this year.

In [1990](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1990/ "A guide to the year 1990") Matthew added another series regular in the form of Little Cousin Scampi, who quickly became a fan favourite.

Revamping the series in [1992](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1992/ "A guide to the year 1992"), [Sooty & Co.](https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/sooty_co/ "Sooty & Co.: 1993 - 1998 ITV1 sitcom. Click for a guide.") saw Corbett and the gang running a shop. Guest stars in this iteration included a very young [Paul Zerdin](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/paul_zerdin/ "Paul Zerdin profile") (*Tidy Box*), [Jack Dee](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/jack_dee/ "Jack Dee profile") (*Stars In Their Eyes*), [Harry Hill](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/harry_hill/ "Harry Hill profile") (*Estate Agents*) and [Paul Merton](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/paul_merton/ "Paul Merton profile") (*Buy Buy Everybody*). Merton's appearance was later used in a round on [Have I Got News For You](https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/hignfy/ "Have I Got News For You: 1990 - 2024 BBC One panel show about the news. Click for a guide."), a clip of which can be seen on [The Paul Merton Collection](https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/room_101/shop/766/the_paul_merton_collection_dvd/ "More details about this product") DVD.

Matthew even got into trouble for one particular script called *Soo's Babies*, which had Soo pretend to be pregnant by stuffing a pillow up her dress. It received complaints from viewers and ended up being reported in the national press.

### Sooty Heights

![Sooty Heights](https://cdn.comedy.co.uk/images/library/comedies/900x450/s/sooty_heights.jpg "Sooty Heights")

In [1996](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1996/ "A guide to the year 1996"), Sooty joined the likes of [Victoria Wood](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/victoria_wood/ "Victoria Wood profile"), [Billy Connolly](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/billy_connolly/ "Billy Connolly profile") and [Ken Dodd](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/ken_dodd/ "Ken Dodd profile") when [ITV](https://www.comedy.co.uk/pro/blackbook/companies/itv/ "Find out more about ITV") aired the entertainment special *An Audience With Sooty*, which saw Matthew and the gang entertain a celebrity audience and their children. It is one of only two home video releases of Matthew and Sooty live on stage, and it's a wonderful example of just how brilliant a comic performer Matthew was, committing so fully to everything from slapstick sequences like Sooty slapping him in the face and then refusing to go to sleep, to delivering jokes that both the children and their parents in the audience can enjoy, it is an absolute masterclass in comedy.

The following year, Sooty and Matthew made a rare appearance on an adult-orientated show, when they appeared as panellists on the [1997](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1997/ "A guide to the year 1997") Christmas special of [They Think It's All Over](https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/they_think_its_all_over/ "They Think It's All Over: 1995 - 2006 BBC One panel show loosely themed around sport. Click for a guide."). Their only other notable appearance outside the realms of children's entertainment was an episode of [Bobby Davro](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/bobby_davro/ "Bobby Davro profile")'s sketch show in [1989](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1989/ "A guide to the year 1989") called *Sooty In Soho*, with Davro impersonating Matthew, before the real Matthew and Sooty appear at the end to put a stop to it.

Having conquered stage and screen, one of the more bizarre offshoots was *Sooty's Amazing Adventures*, an animated series which ran from [1997](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1997/ "A guide to the year 1997") until [1998](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1998/ "A guide to the year 1998"). Although Sooty remained steadfastly silent, Sweep talked, with the voice of [Rob Rackstraw](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/rob_rackstraw/ "Rob Rackstraw profile"), Soo was now voiced by [Susie Blake](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/susie_blake/ "Susie Blake profile") and Little Cousin Scampi was voiced by [Jimmy Hibbert](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/jimmy_hibbert/ "Jimmy Hibbert profile"). No longer confined to puppetry, the characters walk around, fall through a time portal and go on adventures.

Yes, really.

[Richard Cadell](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/richard_cadell/ "Richard Cadell profile"), along with Liana Bridges, appeared as regulars in the final series of [Sooty & Co.](https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/sooty_co/ "Sooty & Co.: 1993 - 1998 ITV1 sitcom. Click for a guide.") in [1998](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1998/ "A guide to the year 1998") to prepare viewers for the changing of hands, so to speak, and Matthew officially retired. The following year, Cadell and Bridges presented [Sooty Heights](https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/sooty-heights/ "Sooty Heights: 1999 - 2004 ITV1 sitcom. Click for a guide."), which saw the gang run a seaside hotel.

The programme firmly established Cadell as Sooty's new right hand man, frequently incorporating magic tricks, and saw even more guest stars appear - including [Robin Parkinson](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/robin_parkinson/ "Robin Parkinson profile") and [Marcia Warren](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/marcia_warren/ "Marcia Warren profile") (*Friends And Romans*), [Matthew Kelly](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/matthew_kelly/ "Matthew Kelly profile") (*To Share Is To Care*) and [Brian Blessed](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/brian_blessed/ "Brian Blessed profile"), the latter of whom is the only person to have guest starred on [Sooty & Co.](https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/sooty_co/ "Sooty & Co.: 1993 - 1998 ITV1 sitcom. Click for a guide."), [Sooty Heights](https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/sooty-heights/ "Sooty Heights: 1999 - 2004 ITV1 sitcom. Click for a guide.") and [Sooty](https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/sooty/ "Sooty: 2011 - 2018 ITVBe sitcom about a group of puppets. Click for a guide.") (*1997 Christmas Special*, *You Must Be Joking* and *Pranks and Presents*).

In [2001](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/2001/ "A guide to the year 2001"), the show was refreshed and retitled [Sooty](https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/sooty/ "Sooty: 2011 - 2018 ITVBe sitcom about a group of puppets. Click for a guide."), with Vicki Lee Taylor appearing alongside Cadell. However, the quality of the scripts was going downhill, and Cadell has stated in interviews that he felt the series was losing sight of the magic formula that made Sooty a success in the first place. It came to an end in [2004](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/2004/ "A guide to the year 2004"), going on an indefinite hiatus.

![Sooty. Richard (Richard Cadell)](https://cdn.comedy.co.uk/images/library/comedies/900x450/s/sooty_group.jpg "Sooty. Richard &#40;Richard Cadell&#41;")

[2008](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/2008/ "A guide to the year 2008") saw the rights to Sooty put up for sale, and Cadell snapped them up. He set about returning the show to television, first by making a straight-to-DVD special, *Sooty's Big Day Out* ([2009](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/2009/ "A guide to the year 2009")), before a new iteration of [Sooty](https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/sooty/ "Sooty: 2011 - 2018 ITVBe sitcom about a group of puppets. Click for a guide.") hit [CITV](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/channel/citv/ "More details about CITV") in [2011](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/2011/ "A guide to the year 2011").

Co-writer [Wink Taylor](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/wink_taylor/ "Wink Taylor profile") explained that, when scripting the series: "All the writers are very much encouraged to look back on the past episodes for inspiration. I consider [Harry Corbett](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/harry_corbett/ "Harry Corbett profile") to be the master and I was lucky enough to meet him as a child. It was like meeting the Wizard of Oz - he was magical! I remember one episode where Sooty built a space rocket and I asked Richard if I could modernise the story. I was thrilled when the writing was credited to [Harry Corbett](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/harry_corbett/ "Harry Corbett profile") and [Wink Taylor](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/wink_taylor/ "Wink Taylor profile"). To be credited alongside a giant of children's entertainment was a dream come true."

This latest incarnation of [Sooty](https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/sooty/ "Sooty: 2011 - 2018 ITVBe sitcom about a group of puppets. Click for a guide.") re-established the classic formula, quickly propelling the beloved yellow bear to the apex of children's television once more. He even made headlines in [2011](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/2011/ "A guide to the year 2011") when [Paul Daniels](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/paul_daniels/ "Paul Daniels profile") was hospitalised due to an injury sustained when Sooty threw a pizza at his head!

So, what's next for Sooty? In [2022](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/2022/ "A guide to the year 2022") Cadell launched *Sooty Land*, a new area at Crealy Theme Park in Exeter, which features rides, attractions and a Hall Of Fame museum, chock full of Sooty goodies and memorabilia. For quite some time there has also been talk of a Sooty feature film: Cadell has explained in interviews that it is stuck in development but he hopes to get it off the ground eventually. With a new series and a tour coming up, it seems that 75 years is just the start for Sooty.

There's only one thing left to say:

> Bye bye, everybody. Bye bye!
