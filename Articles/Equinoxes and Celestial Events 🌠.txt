> The statement *"From [the equinox] the light will fade faster in the evenings"* is **misleading or incorrect** if interpreted as a claim about the *rate* of change in daylight.

Let’s clarify with accuracy:

### 🌍 Key Astronomical Facts:

1. **Equinoxes (around March 20 and September 22):**
   - These are the times when day and night are approximately equal in length.
   - More importantly, **the rate of change in daylight is at its maximum** around the equinoxes.
   - That means:
     - Around the **autumn equinox**, daylight **decreases most rapidly** each day.
     - Around the **spring equinox**, daylight **increases most rapidly**.

2. **Solstices (around June 21 and December 21):**
   - These mark the longest and shortest days of the year.
   - The **rate of change in daylight is near zero** at the solstices.
   - Just after the winter solstice, we begin gaining daylight, but very slowly at first.

### So, correcting the statement:

> ❌ *"From [the equinox] the light will fade faster in the evenings."*

This phrasing is ambiguous and easily misunderstood. If it suggests that the *rate* of darkening increases *after* the equinox, that's **not accurate** — because we are **already at the peak rate of darkening** *during* the autumn equinox.

✅ A more accurate version would be:

> *"Around the autumn equinox, daylight fades most quickly — we lose the most minutes of sunlight per day. After that, the daily loss slows down until the winter solstice, when it stops and we begin to gain daylight again."*

Or more poetically, but still correctly:

> *"After the autumn equinox, the evenings continue to darken, but the speed at which they do so gradually decreases as we approach the winter solstice."*

---

### Summary:

- ✅ **The equinoxes are the times of fastest change** in day length — not the start of an accelerating change.
- ❌ It's incorrect to say light fades "faster" *from* the equinox onward — in fact, the fading *slows down* after the equinox.
- 🌞 The winter solstice is the turning point when the loss of light stops and the slow return begins.

The equinoxes are the peaks of change, not the beginning of increasing darkness *in rate*. Well observed! 🙌
