## Exhaust Setup and Modifications for Optimal Performance

### Proper Exhaust Routing
- **Swap the Exhaust Orientation**: Change the exhaust to prevent it from exiting directly downward. This generates excess heat in the underplate and can lead to a rise in temperature (up to 5 degrees over the desired level). It also increases fuel consumption.
- **Avoid Water Accumulation**: Ensure there's no bending that could trap water or unburnt diesel. Route the exhaust downwards from the unit, then use a 90-degree bend angled slightly downwards outside, allowing proper drainage.

### Hose and Fuel Lines
- **Heat Hose Position**: Install the heat hose at the front to pull heat away from the burner nozzle. This adjustment can optimize fuel consumption, allowing it to burn at the ideal temperature of 163-167°C with a fuel-air ratio of 14:1.
- **Use Rigid Fuel Lines**: Consider installing rigid fuel lines, similar to those used in boats. They provide more accurate fueling by eliminating flex and expansion during the pump's operation, resulting in quieter burner operation and prolonged pump life.

### Critical Do's and Don'ts
- **Avoid Filters on the Intake**: Filters can restrict airflow.
- **Limit Bends in Exhaust and Intake**: Excess bends can lead to inefficiencies.
- **Wiring Precautions**: Do not extend wiring without calculating the resistance, and prefer 12V or 24V DC power. Mains power can lead to spikes or cuts, damaging the heater.
- **Pump Positioning**: Research the ideal height and angle for the pump; incorrect positioning can cause fuel line issues.
- **Pump Noise Reduction**: Use a pink rubber cover to dampen pump noise, and ensure it doesn't touch any surrounding surfaces.
- **Tank Recommendations**: Avoid thin, large tanks due to leakage risks. If using a 5-gallon drum, ensure that it has a proper breathable blue lid.

### Maintenance and Replacement Tips
- Genuine setups can handle about **5-6 hard shut downs** before needing part replacement. Keep this in mind for long-term maintenance.
- Always be cautious with installation to prevent future issues with the electronic components, which can be easily damaged during abrupt shutdowns.

Implementing these guidelines will ensure longevity and efficiency, enhancing your experience as a boat builder and operator of these systems.

I fitted these on boats and lorries for years, I'm a boat builder now so still deal with them and if set up correctly they last forever👍
First thing mate you need to  swap that exhaust around so its not all exiting facing directly down as you generate extra heat in the underplate and if left on constantly for days the burner will be running maybe 5deg over what it should and using more fuel and the bend you cant have it so water and unburnt  diesel stores in it or it will have start-up issues. Route the exhaust slightly downwards all the way from the unit so have it come out and down slightly then where it goes outside put your 90 bend sideways and facing downwards then have the exhaust aimed out at a slight dangle downwards so no water or unburnt fuel can store up anywhere on the pipe. 
Secondly you should fit the heat hose to the front as it brings the heat away from the burner nozzle and in turn saves fuel as its then  burning at a perfect 163-167deg and 14:1 on the fuel.  
The best modification you can make for performance is to fit rigid type fuel lines like you get on the boats. They do cheap copy kits that the fuel line is nearly rigid and fits into rubber fuel hose and is clamped together. These ensure the fueling is absolutely accurate as there is no flex or expanding action happening when the pump is on its press stroke, the burner itself will be quieter and the fuel pump will last a lot longer with rigid type fuel hose🙏
What never to do >  fit filters over the intake. Put too many bends in the exhaust or burner intake. Extend the wiring without doing the maths relating to wire resistance and if possible always use it on a 12v or 24v DC  as mains power can sometimes have power cuts or large spikes that flip breakers... if that happens your heater is toast as it shuts down hard with no shut down sequence, this burns the internal pcb and internal wiring. The genuine ones can take about 5-6 hard shut downs before you need to replace certain parts of the electrics. Also do some homework at what height and angle the pump likes to be at as these all in ones are known for bad fuel lines and pumps facing the wrong direction.  To quieten  the pump down you can get the pink rubber cover thing for it and mount it so it's not touching anything. Never buy the garbage large thin tanks they all leak and the connector is a nightmare to snug up properly. If using a 5 gallon drum be sure to fit the blue lid on your current tank to it as it needs to breathe.
