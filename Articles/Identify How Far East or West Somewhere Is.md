*Santiago lies to the east of Miami. As well as being south of North America, South America is also east of much of it.*

<span style="color: inherit;"><span style="color: inherit;">To identify how far east or west somewhere is, we use a measurement called longitude. We can divide the Earth into segments by drawing lines that go from the North to the South Poles, around the world. One line is drawn through Greenwich in London. It is known as the Prime Meridian and has the value of 0° longitude. On the exact opposite side of the world is the other side of the line, known as the International Date Line, which has the value of 180°.</span></span>

<span style="color: inherit;"><span style="color: inherit;">Everywhere else in the world falls between these two lines, either to the east of the Prime Meridian or the west. They are assigned a number between 0 and 180 and a designation of east or west.</span></span>

<span style="color: inherit;"><span style="color: inherit;">Santiago is 70° west whereas Miami is 80° west. 80 is closer to 180 so Miami is further west than Santiago.</span></span>
