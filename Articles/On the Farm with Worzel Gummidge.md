It's rare enough for an actor to play one iconic character during their career. [Jon Pertwee](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/jon_pertwee/ "Jon Pertwee profile") was lucky enough to play two. Coming hot off the success of playing the Third Doctor in *Doctor Who*, he enjoyed a second bout of cult fame when he played the eponymous country bumpkin scarecrow in [Worzel Gummidge](https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/worzel_gummidge/ "Worzel Gummidge: 1979 - 1981 ITV1 sitcom about a scarecrow. Click for a guide.") from [1979](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1979/ "A guide to the year 1979").

Pertwee had hitherto been best known as a comic actor, notably appearing in the long-running radio sitcom [The Navy Lark](https://www.comedy.co.uk/radio/the_navy_lark/ "The Navy Lark: 1959 - 1977 BBC Light Programme sitcom about life on the waves. Click for a guide."), a role close to his heart, having served in the Royal Navy for six years. (His time in the forces even saw him serve in the Naval Intelligence Division alongside future *James Bond* scribe [Ian Fleming](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/ian_fleming/ "Ian Fleming profile").) [Ronnie Barker](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/ronnie_barker/ "Ronnie Barker profile") was amongst his co-stars in the early series, and after Barker left Pertwee took on a more substantial role, voicing many additional characters.

[Keith Waterhouse](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/keith_waterhouse/ "Keith Waterhouse profile") and [Willis Hall](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/willis_hall/ "Willis Hall profile") were also well-established, as writers. The former had written the acclaimed novel [Billy Liar](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/keith_waterhouse/shop/7777/billy-liar/ "More details about this product") in [1959](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1959/ "A guide to the year 1959"), which the duo later adapted into an immensely successful stage play, film, musical and, later, a television sitcom, all of the same name. Their film work, which included *A Kind Of Loving* and *Whistle Down The Wind*, was of such high quality that [Alfred Hitchcock](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/alfred_hitchcock/ "Alfred Hitchcock profile") hired them to polish the screenplay of *Torn Curtain* in [1966](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1966/ "A guide to the year 1966"), whilst their comedy credits included [The Dick Emery Show](https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/the_dick_emery_show/ "The Dick Emery Show: 1963 - 1981 BBC One sketch show starring Dick Emery. Click for a guide.") and [The Frost Report](https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/frost_report/ "The Frost Report: 1966 - 1967 BBC One sketch show satirising various topics. Click for a guide.").

Worzel Gummidge had been created in [1936](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1936/ "A guide to the year 1936") by author [Barbara Euphan Todd](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/barbara_euphan_todd/ "Barbara Euphan Todd profile"), who [wrote ten books about the character](https://amzn.to/3CvIAEm), the final published in [1963](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1963/ "A guide to the year 1963"). It was first adapted for radio in collaboration with actress and writer [Mabel Constanduros](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/mabel_constanduros/ "Mabel Constanduros profile"): [Barry Took](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/barry_took/ "Barry Took profile") once said of Constanduros that "although today her reputation has faded, she was a popular cultural figure between the wars, helping to establish the style and flavour of British radio comedy". The two later collaborated again to adapt the series for television in [1953](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1953/ "A guide to the year 1953")'s [Worzel Gummidge Turns Detective](https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/worzel_gummidge_turns_detective/ "Worzel Gummidge Turns Detective: 1953 BBC One sitcom about a scarecrow. Click for a guide.") (now long lost), with Todd writing the scripts. [Frank Atkinson](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/frank_atkinson/ "Frank Atkinson profile") took on the title role.

According to Pertwee's memoir, his version of [Worzel Gummidge](https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/worzel_gummidge/ "Worzel Gummidge: 1979 - 1981 ITV1 sitcom about a scarecrow. Click for a guide.") was originally pitched as a feature film, which would have told the story of "the scarecrow equivalent of the Peasant's Revolt". Willis and Hall adapted the role of Worzel specifically for and around him, inspired by a postman character he played more than thirty years earlier in [1948](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1948/ "A guide to the year 1948")'s [BBC](https://www.comedy.co.uk/pro/blackbook/companies/bbc/ "Find out more about BBC") radio comedy [Waterlogged Spa](https://www.comedy.co.uk/radio/waterlogged-spa/ "Waterlogged Spa: 1948 - 1949 BBC Light Programme sitcom. Click for a guide."), due to the actor's performance imbuing the character with a strong Devonshire accent.

Eager to take on the role, Pertwee encouraged Waterhouse and Hall to rewrite the script as a television series. They pitched the series to Head of Drama at the [BBC](https://www.comedy.co.uk/pro/blackbook/companies/bbc/ "Find out more about BBC"), [Shaun Sutton](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/shaun_sutton/ "Shaun Sutton profile"), and to [Philip Jones](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/philip_jones/ "Philip Jones profile") at [Thames Television](https://www.comedy.co.uk/pro/blackbook/companies/thames_television/ "Find out more about Thames Television"), without success. All hope appeared to be lost, until [Lewis Rudd](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/lewis_rudd/ "Lewis Rudd profile") at ITV regional broadcaster for the south east of England, [Southern Television](https://www.comedy.co.uk/pro/blackbook/companies/southern_television/ "Find out more about Southern Television"), heard about the show and enthusiastically commissioned it.

Sadly, Todd never lived to see the most popular iteration of her scarecrow reach the screen, passing away in [1976](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1976/ "A guide to the year 1976"), just as final negotiations were getting underway.

The core premise for the series is that Worzel is a scarecrow who can come to life, more often than not running amok, absent from his post in Ten Acre Field. The first episode sees him visit the nearby Scatterbrook farmhouse, where he befriends children John and Sue Peters, played by [Jeremy Austin](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/jeremy_austin/ "Jeremy Austin profile") and [Charlotte Coleman](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/charlotte_coleman/ "Charlotte Coleman profile"), who have just moved to the area with their father.

Each episode typically finds Worzel getting himself into a variety of scrapes and shenanigans, with John and Sue forced to extricate him. He regularly visits life-size fairground doll Aunt Sally, with whom he is madly in love. Unfortunately, she has an intensely devious, selfish and cruel streak: she cannot stand Worzel but he cannot see this past his adoration; a dynamic she exploits in order to deceive and manipulate him to her own ends at every possible turn. Despite her often horrid nature and the foul things she said to Worzel, Aunt Sally became one of the most popular characters in the series.

Aunt Sally was a role originally offered to actress and [Carry On](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/group/carry_on/ "Click to find out more about Carry On.") star [Amanda Barrie](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/amanda_barrie/ "Amanda Barrie profile"), who turned it down. Pertwee asked [Una Stubbs](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/una_stubbs/ "Una Stubbs profile") to take on the role: they had worked together in a [1975](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1975/ "A guide to the year 1975") production of [Aladdin](https://www.comedy.co.uk/fringe/search/?q=Aladdin "More details on the Edinburgh Fringe shows called Aladdin") at the Richmond Theatre, and it was her dance and performance skills on that stage that caught his imagination. Like Pertwee, she was already a household name, having starred as Rita Rawlins in the hugely popular sitcom [Till Death Us Do Part](https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/till_death_us_do_part/ "Till Death Us Do Part: 1965 - 1975 BBC One sitcom about a bigoted man and his family. Click for a guide.") (and its various sequels) since [1965](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1965/ "A guide to the year 1965").

(Coincidentally, that stage production had also featured [Barbara Windsor](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/barbara_windsor/ "Barbara Windsor profile"), who would make a guest appearance in the series as ship's figurehead and potential rival for Worzel's affections, Saucy Nancy.)

It's immediately apparent when watching [Worzel Gummidge](https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/worzel_gummidge/ "Worzel Gummidge: 1979 - 1981 ITV1 sitcom about a scarecrow. Click for a guide.") that [Jon Pertwee](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/jon_pertwee/ "Jon Pertwee profile") is having an absolute ball: his character's childish sense of play, lack of responsibility and propensity to mock authority figures quickly endeared him to the series' young audience (it was broadcast around 5pm). After so many years starring as the eponymous hero in *Doctor Who* - a stoic authority figure - Worzel allowed Pertwee to unleash the skills and considerable comic talents he picked up working as a circus performer after leaving school. An ingenious invention of Waterhouse and Hall's, Worzel has interchangeable heads to suit different personalities and tasks, including those fashioned from mangelwurzels, swedes and turnips, as well as a festive variety for the Christmas special, all allowing him to play in an even wider variety of comic styles.

One of the greatest joys of the series is in seeing how much fun Pertwee and Stubbs are having with the parts they play, and with each other, developing into a kind of double act. There is wonderful chemistry between the two as Aunt Sally mercilessly teases Worzel, while he always naively believes that, this time, she might actually follow through with her promises.

The other key character was the Crowman, played by [Geoffrey Bayldon](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/geoffrey_bayldon/ "Geoffrey Bayldon profile"). The Crowman created Worzel (and many other scarecrows besides), and as such is often used as a device to explain various plot contrivances as well as provide Worzel with a new head whenever one is needed. Bayldon was also already well known, especially to younger viewers, as the star of [Catweazle](https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/catweazle/ "Catweazle: 1970 - 1971 ITV1 comedy drama for children. Click for a guide.") from [1970](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1970/ "A guide to the year 1970") to [1971](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1971/ "A guide to the year 1971").

One notable aspect of the series is the titular character's propensity to speak in Worzelese, a fictitious language used by scarecrows to communicate with each other. It entails spelling words letter-by-letter, but adding 'wor' after each, and adding either 'zel' or 'dip' to the end of each word, depending on whether it is over three characters long or not. Worzel's first name, for instance, would be spoken in Worzelese as "W-wor-O-wor-R-wor-Z-wor-E-wor-L-wor-zel". This was also the centrepiece of *Worzel's Song*, a track based on the jaunty theme tune composed by [George Evans](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/george_evans/ "George Evans profile"), in which Pertwee, as Worzel, explains the language. It reached number 33 in the UK charts upon its release in [1980](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1980/ "A guide to the year 1980").

Regular characters included [Oh No It's Selwyn Froggitt](https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/oh_no_selwyn_froggitt/ "Oh No It's Selwyn Froggitt: 1974 - 1978 ITV1 sitcom about a well-meaning fool. Click for a guide.") actor [Bill Maynard](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/bill_maynard/ "Bill Maynard profile") as Sgt Beetroot, [Carry On](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/group/carry_on/ "Click to find out more about Carry On.") stalwart [Joan Sims](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/joan_sims/ "Joan Sims profile") as Mrs Bloomsbury-Barton, [Mike Berry](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/mike_berry/ "Mike Berry profile") as Mr Peters (John and Sue's father), [Megs Jenkins](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/megs_jenkins/ "Megs Jenkins profile") as Mrs Braithwaite and [Norman Bird](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/norman_bird/ "Norman Bird profile") - perhaps best known as henpecked husband Mr Arrad in the *Waldorf Salad* episode of [Fawlty Towers](https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/fawlty_towers/ "Fawlty Towers: 1975 - 1979 BBC Two sitcom about a badly run hotel.

Other comic actors who popped up during the series include [John Le Mesurier](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/john_le_mesurier/ "John Le Mesurier profile"), [Mike Reid](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/mike_reid/ "Mike Reid profile"), [Jimmy Jewel](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/jimmy_jewel/ "Jimmy Jewel profile"), [Beryl Reid](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/beryl_reid/ "Beryl Reid profile"), [Lorraine Chase](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/lorraine_chase/ "Lorraine Chase profile"), [David Lodge](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/david_lodge/ "David Lodge profile") and [Gordon Rollings](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/gordon_rollings/ "Gordon Rollings profile"). In Series 4, the late [Bernard Cribbins](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/bernard_cribbins/ "Bernard Cribbins profile") played Jolly Jack and [Connie Booth](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/connie_booth/ "Connie Booth profile") played Aunt Sally 2. Booth and Stubbs were close friends, with Stubbs appearing in the [Fawlty Towers](https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/fawlty_towers/ "Fawlty Towers: 1975 - 1979 BBC Two sitcom about a badly run hotel. Click for a guide.") episode *The Anniversary*.

A lot of the credit for the show's success must go to director [James Hill](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/james_hill/ "James Hill profile"). At the time of the series' conception, Hill was working with Pertwee's *Doctor Who* successor, [Tom Baker](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/tom_baker/ "Tom Baker profile"), to get a feature film, *Doctor Who Meets Scratchman* (a story that, coincidentally, also featured scarecrows), off the ground. He and Pertwee got on famously and became lifelong friends. His stoic demeanour and strong work ethic guided the crew through an often gruelling production schedule, but he also established the aesthetic look of the series, with Worzel's grimy, believably earthy appearance contrasting with the bucolic beauty surrounding him.

The show's popularity was such that for Christmas [1980](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1980/ "A guide to the year 1980"), Waterhouse and Hall penned a stage musical, which premiered at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre before transferring to the Cambridge Theatre in London the following year. Pertwee, Stubbs and Bayldon all reprised their roles, with music by television composer [Denis King](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/denis_king/ "Denis King profile"), who is perhaps best known for performing in the [BBC](https://www.comedy.co.uk/pro/blackbook/companies/bbc/ "Find out more about BBC") radio, later television, show [Hello, Cheeky!](https://www.comedy.co.uk/radio/hello_cheeky/ "Hello, Cheeky!: 1973 - 1979 BBC Radio 2 sketch show. Click for a guide.") (alongside [Barry Cryer](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/barry_cryer/ "Barry Cryer profile"), [John Junkin](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/john_junkin/ "John Junkin profile") and [Tim Brooke-Taylor](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/tim_brooke_taylor/ "Tim Brooke-Taylor profile")). This resulted in the release of a full cast album, which remains in circulation to this day.

Worzel also became a popular target for impressionists, with [Ronnie Barker](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/ronnie_barker/ "Ronnie Barker profile") playing the character in Episode 3 of Series 10 of [The Two Ronnies](https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/the_two_ronnies/ "The Two Ronnies: 1971 - 1987 BBC One sketch show starring Ronnies Corbett and Barker. Click for a guide."), while [Bobby Davro](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/bobby_davro/ "Bobby Davro profile") did an impression in Episode 4 of [Davro's Sketch Pad](https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/davros_sketch_pad/ "Davro's Sketch Pad: 1989 ITV1 sketch show. Click for a guide.") in [1989](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1989/ "A guide to the year 1989").

30 episodes were made between [1979](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1979/ "A guide to the year 1979") and [1981](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1981/ "A guide to the year 1981") over four series. A sequel series set in Ireland entered pre-production shortly thereafter. Sets were constructed and contracts signed, but just a few days before filming was due to begin, the plug was pulled and the finance lost. After a hiatus, a sequel series finally entered production in [1987](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1987/ "A guide to the year 1987").

[Worzel Gummidge Down Under](https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/worzel_gummidge_down_under/ "Worzel Gummidge Down Under: 1987 - 1989 Channel 4 sitcom about a scarecrow. Click for a guide."), as the title suggests, relocated the action to New Zealand, though retained the leading duo of Pertwee and Stubbs. Bayldon, however, declined to participate, so [Bruce Phillips](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/bruce_phillips/ "Bruce Phillips profile") replaced him as the local Crowman. Perhaps the most notable thing about this series is that it gave *Lord of the Rings* director [Peter Jackson](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/peter_jackson/ "Peter Jackson profile") one of his earliest screen credits, working in the special effects department, and is where he met his wife, [Frances Walsh](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/frances_walsh/ "Frances Walsh profile"), who wrote its second series.

It was Pertwee's last starring role, and though he would continue working in television and straight-to-video *Doctor Who* spin-off films during the [1990](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1990/ "A guide to the year 1990")s (as well as developing further ideas for Worzel projects), his career from this point consisted mainly of personal appearances at conventions, after dinner speaking and pantomime work, until his sudden death in [1996](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1996/ "A guide to the year 1996"). What is clear to see is that Pertwee adored playing Worzel, and he frequently appeared at events in character, revelling in the joy he brought to huge crowds of children: according to his son, fellow actor [Sean Pertwee](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/sean_pertwee/ "Sean Pertwee profile") (who also makes uncredited guest appearances in the series), it was his favourite role of his entire career.

Hall and Waterhouse, meanwhile, continued their careers as hugely successful writers, the latter penning *Jeffrey Bernard Is Unwell*, a play that served as a magnificent showcase for [Peter O'Toole](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/peter_otoole/ "Peter O'Toole profile").

Although the series has been released on home media before, the original film elements were lost for almost 40 years, with only poor quality video copies existing as the "master" material. Following the discovery of the original negatives in storage in Slough in [2018](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/2018/ "A guide to the year 2018"), a new box set is now available on DVD and Blu-ray from [Fabulous Films](https://www.comedy.co.uk/pro/blackbook/companies/fabulous_films/ "Find out more about Fabulous Films"). Not only does it include fully remastered and restored versions of all four series of [Worzel Gummidge](https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/worzel_gummidge/ "Worzel Gummidge: 1979 - 1981 ITV1 sitcom about a scarecrow. Click for a guide."), it is also stuffed full of fascinating bonus features, including brand new audio commentaries, featurettes, out-takes, behind the scenes clips, rare interviews with Pertwee, Stubbs and Bayldon and other archive rarities, including a delightful news item covering the time Stubbs, as Aunt Sally, went to a Downing Street Christmas party for disabled children.

Crook replicates not only the characters of Todd's books, but the charm of the more well-known adaptation, with a gentle environmentalist twist. [Worzel Gummidge](https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/worzel_gummidge_2019/ "Worzel Gummidge: 2019 - 2021 BBC One comedy drama about a scarecrow that comes to life.

With the new box set available, why not relax with a nice cup o' tea an' a slice o' cake and get lost in Worzel's world of whimsy?

Christmas Special - *A Cup O' Tea An' A Slice O' Cake*

The double-length Christmas special from [1980](https://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/year/1980/ "A guide to the year 1980") is set on Christmas Eve, a most important day for scarecrows as they must stand in position to guide Father Christmas back to the North Pole. Worzel, however, deserts his post to enjoy the delights of the season.

With a sizeable increase in budget, this episode is peppered with elaborate musical numbers, as Saucy Nancy teaches Worzel about pantomime and the Crowman hosts the Scarecrow Ball. The special is also notable for featuring [Billy Connolly](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/billy_connolly/ "Billy Connolly profile") as Christmas-hating scarecrow Bogle McNeep, as well as Pertwee sharing a scene with his cousin, [Dad's Army](https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/dads_army/ "Dad's Army: 1968 - 1977 BBC One sitcom about a home guard unit.

[Jon Pertwee](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/jon_pertwee/ "Jon Pertwee profile") stars as Worzel Gummidge, the loveable scarecrow of Scatterbrook Farm. When children John and Sue move to the countryside, they learn that life is never dull with Worzel around. The restless scarecrow dreams of a life away from his post in Ten Acre Field and often wanders off into mischief. Whether getting his heart broken by the creaking fairground doll Aunt Sally ([Una Stubbs](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/una_stubbs/ "Una Stubbs profile")) or disobeying his maker, the eccentric old Crowman ([Geoffrey Bayldon](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/geoffrey_bayldon/ "Geoffrey Bayldon profile")), Worzel is lucky to have his young friends on hand to help rescue him from trouble.

Based on the stories of [Barbara Euphan Todd](https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/barbara_euphan_todd/ "Barbara Euphan Todd profile"), [Worzel Gummidge](https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/worzel_gummidge/ "Worzel Gummidge: 1979 - 1981 ITV1 sitcom about a scarecrow.
