Struggling with daily back pain? Tired of weak, tight glutes? There may just be one exercise that can solve all of your issues, or at least give you a huge head start. For whatever reason, this particular exercise is scarcely used as a rehab modality and has been neglected for years. If you haven't already guessed…

_I'm talking about the side plank leg raise._

While you may think that this is just your run-of-the-mill plank used in HIIT classes, it's got far more going for it than meets the eye. The secret from a rehab perspective is its ability to simultaneously activate the glute medius and quadratus lumborum muscles, two of the most underutilized and weak areas in the human body.

By implementing this movement into your routine, you'll drastically improve your mobility, stability, and strength in key areas of the hips and spine. This will lead to improved sport performance and elevated functionality in activities of daily life. While it may not be enough on its own, it's been a key exercise for many of my patients in rediscovering pain-free living and I'm confident you'll experience similar relief.

### Unlocking Back & Hips for Once and for All

Before we get into any exercise-specific prescriptions, it's important to take a step back and look at the bigger picture. Any time back pain comes up, it's key to think about the holistic steps you can take to expedite recovery. While physical therapy should be near the top of your list of priorities, don't overlook the benefits of incorporating better nutrition, sleep, and stress-relieving practices into your life. If you can combine all of this while staying consistent with movement, the skies the limit!

Additionally, I just want to touch on the on-going narrative that weak glutes automatically cause back pain. It's simply not true. While there are causes when this can they can be connected, the current evidences shows an insignificant correlation between glute strength and back pain.

> Your back pain likely isn't due to weak glutes, at least not directly.

Now you may argue, if that's the case…what's the point of doing exercises at all. The reason why exercise still has validity in this space is that it fosters improved blood flow, joint stability, coordination, and performance throughout daily tasks. While being stronger might not necessarily erase all your problems, being more functional and less sedentary is a recipe for lower stiffness, safer biomechanics, and better pain outcomes throughout the day.

_This is especially true when we find exercises that can wake hidden muscles (like the glute med and quadratus lumborum) and get them back into the line of duty._

The glute medius is the prime mover of abduction at hip joint. It also assists in flexion and medial rotation of hip, along with abduction and lateral rotation. If you're not actively developing it, your lower body may pay the price later on down the road.

The quadratus lumborum on the other hand is a key spine stabilizer that can extend and laterally rotate the spine. It also has a role to play in inspiration. Like the glute med, if you're completely neglecting this area, you'll likely see the tissues in the close vicinity start to grow stiff and grumpy. Again, we can't always draw a direct connection between 'dormant' tissues and back pain, but it will always be in your best interest to keep these muscles as active and strong as possible.

On that note, let's look at the side plank leg raise, along with two effective warm-ups and a helpful modification, to get your body back in balance and function. For the best results, try these at least 3–4 times per week and feel free to implement it all into an established core or leg workout.

If you feel pain or discomfort, feel free to start with the modification and slowly work your way up to the full exercise over time. For those who have injuries or chronic conditions that may put one at risk during physical activity, please talk to a health provider before following the advice below.

#### Warm-Up 1) Side-Lying Straight-Leg Raise

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/DDSsRT8b/Straight-Leg-Raise.jpg" alt="" border="1" width="500" height="200">

**Application:** 10–15 reps / side

**Cues:** Lie on your side with your legs stacked on top of each other. On an exhale, raise the top leg off of the floor while keeping the leg internally rotated with the heel leading. Keep the core lightly braced as you go through each rep and hold at the top for 2–3 seconds to improve your endurance. Go for 10–15 consecutive reps and then switch over to the other side and repeat.

#### Warm-Up 2) The QL Walk

![The QL Walk](https://res.cloudinary.com/dot2lwii3/image/upload/v1747049424/the_ql_walk_izazvw.jpg)

**Application:** 8–10 walks forward + backward x 2/3 bouts

**Cues:** Start in a seated position with your legs extended out in front of you. Next, slowly shuffle your way forwards by subtly shifting the hips back and forth while keeping the spine upright. After a few feet, try repeating this process going backward. While this exercise may look slightly ridiculous, it does a fantastic job at isolating the QL group and waking up the deep posterior muscles of the core.

If you're looking for progressions, try doing this movement with the arms overhead or you can even add a weight (as seen in the photo above). As an important reminder, please continue to do this movement even after your back pain has subsided. While it's great to use this as a rehab tool, it's even better if you make it part of your life to prevent your next injury.

#### Exercise of the Day: Leg Raise Plank

**Application:** 10–15 reps / side

**Cues:** Start by propping up into a regular side plank and then do slow, controlled pulses of straight leg raises. On these raises, ensure your leg stays internally rotated so that the heel and toes are relatively in line. This is a really easy one to get lazy on but do your very best to keep the bottom hip elevated and engaged.

This exercise works wonders for strengthening your obliques, shoulders, low back, and glutes. We don't train in this frontal plane nearly enough, but it's incredibly functional and good for injury prevention. It's quite tough to pull off correctly, so don't be shy to start on your knees before going for the full package.

#### Modification: Knee Plank Version

**Application:** 10–15 reps / side

**Cues:** Get into a side plank position and then slowly raise and lower the top leg while keeping the trunk stable and hips high. One important cue here is that you must keep the leg internally rotated. In other words, focus on keeping the top leg's heel in line with the toes.

If you can easily do this for 45 seconds to a minute, consider transitioning to the full one above. This exercise will ensure you maintain strength and stability in the hip stabilizers and core during your injury.

### In Closing,

The side-lying leg raise is far more than your average core exercise. It's unique position and range of motions allows you to recruit key hip and spine stabilizers that often go neglected. This will decrease back-related complications and improve your overall functionality. All the while, you'll build a more robust core and lower body to help you live each day pain-free. What are you waiting for? It's time to add this exercise to your routine today.
