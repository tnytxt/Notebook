In ancient Rome, the two main social classes were [patricians and plebeians](https://www.ancient-origins.net/ancient-places-europe/patricians-and-plebeians-0011266) 

Patricians were the wealthy, landowning aristocrats who held most political and religious power. In contrast, plebeians comprised the common people - farmers, artisans, and merchants - who were largely excluded from positions of power and privilege.

Over time, plebeians fought for their rights and eventually achieved equality with patricians, leading to significant political and social changes in Rome.
