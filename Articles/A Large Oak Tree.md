The oak tree with its lovely curly leaves is one of the most recognisable trees in the UK. It can grow to be up to 40 metres tall! They grow hard, brown shiny fruit called acorns.

Oak trees are linked to royalty - kings and emperors were crowned with oak leaf wreaths. It was seen as a sacred tree to druids and mythological gods like Zeus and Jupiter.
