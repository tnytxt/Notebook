### Exhaust Setup and Modifications for Optimal Performance

> I fitted these on boats and lorries for years, I'm a boat builder now so still deal with them and if set up correctly they last forever👍

### Proper Exhaust Routing
- **Swap the Exhaust Orientation**: Change the exhaust to prevent it from exiting directly downward. This generates excess heat in the under-plate and can lead to a rise in temperature (up to 5 degrees over the desired level). It also increases fuel consumption.
- **Avoid Water Accumulation**: Ensure there's no bending that could trap water or unburnt diesel. Route the exhaust downwards from the unit, then use a 90-degree bend angled slightly downwards outside, allowing proper drainage.

### Hose and Fuel Lines
- **Heat Hose Position**: Install the heat hose at the front to pull heat away from the burner nozzle. This adjustment can optimise fuel consumption, allowing it to burn at the ideal temperature of 163-167°C with a fuel-air ratio of 14:1.
- **Use Rigid Fuel Lines**: Consider installing rigid fuel lines, similar to those used in boats. They provide more accurate fuelling by eliminating flex and expansion during the pump's operation, resulting in quieter burner operation and prolonged pump life.

### Critical Do's and Don'ts
- **Avoid Filters on the Intake**: Filters can restrict airflow.
- **Limit Bends in Exhaust and Intake**: Excess bends can lead to inefficiencies.
- **Wiring Precautions**: Do not extend wiring without calculating the resistance, and prefer 12V or 24V DC power. Mains power can lead to spikes or cuts, damaging the heater.
- **Pump Positioning**: Research the ideal height and angle for the pump; incorrect positioning can cause fuel line issues.
- **Pump Noise Reduction**: Use a pink rubber cover to dampen pump noise, and ensure it doesn't touch any surrounding surfaces.
- **Tank Recommendations**: Avoid thin, large tanks due to leakage risks. If using a 5-gallon drum, ensure that it has a proper breathable blue lid.

### Maintenance and Replacement Tips
- Genuine setups can handle about **5-6 hard shut downs** before needing part replacement. Keep this in mind for long-term maintenance.
- Always be cautious with installation to prevent future issues with the electronic components, which can be easily damaged during abrupt shutdowns.

Implementing these guidelines will ensure longevity and efficiency, enhancing your experience as a boat builder and operator of these systems.

I’ve fitted these systems on boats and lorries for years, and now as a boat builder, I still work with them. When set up correctly, they can last indefinitely. 

Firstly, you need to swap the exhaust so that it doesn’t exit directly downward. This configuration generates excessive heat in the underplate, which can lead to the burner running about 5 degrees hotter than necessary if it operates continuously for days. This not only wastes fuel but can also cause start-up issues due to the accumulation of water and unburnt diesel in the bends. Route the exhaust slightly downward from the unit, allowing it to exit and then angle it down a bit. Where it exits, position the 90-degree bend sideways and facing downward, ensuring that the exhaust has a slight downward angle to prevent water or unburnt fuel from pooling.

Secondly, install the heat hose towards the front. This positioning moves heat away from the burner nozzle, optimizing fuel efficiency by maintaining a consistent temperature of around 163-167 degrees with a fuel ratio of 14:1.

For improved performance, one of the best modifications is to use rigid fuel lines, similar to those found on boats. There are low-cost kits available that feature semi-rigid lines that fit into rubber hoses and are securely clamped. This setup ensures accurate fuel delivery since there’s no flex or expansion occurring during the pump's press strokes. Additionally, it results in a quieter burner and extends the lifespan of the fuel pump.

Certain practices should be avoided. Never fit filters over the intake or create excessive bends in the exhaust or burner intake. Be cautious when extending wiring; always consider wire resistance to avoid complications. It’s usually best to operate on a 12V or 24V DC system, as mains power can experience spikes or outages, which could severely damage your heater by shutting down without a proper sequence. This abrupt failure can burn out the internal PCB and wiring. Genuine units can withstand about five to six hard shutdowns before requiring replacement of specific electrical components.

Lastly, research the optimal height and angle for the pump's installation. These all-in-one systems are notorious for having poorly positioned fuel lines and pumps. If noise is a concern, consider acquiring the foam cover designed for the pump and mount it where it doesn't touch any surfaces. Avoid cheap, thin tanks, as they tend to leak and have unreliable connectors. If you're using a 5-gallon drum, ensure you attach the blue lid from your current tank to it, allowing for proper ventilation.
