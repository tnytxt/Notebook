Attributes: odourless, Invisible, Tasteless,  Heavier than oxygen


Where it lurks: Deep water wells

info Snippets: 
- CO₂ won’t kill you instantly. Like any asphyxiant, it displaces oxygen, and you still have about a minute of usable air in your lungs. If you notice it, you can often reach fresh air. In INERGEN (argon + CO₂) fire-suppression systems, CO₂ is added to trigger a gasping urge that makes you want to escape—an unnerving but life-saving effect.

- Two men were deep in the mine when they started feeling strange; one passed out while the other managed to escape. Interestingly, the survivor was a smoker and had built up a tolerance to carbon dioxide, which saved his life—one of the rare cases where smoking literally helped! lmao
